  Quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
  indeed a fundamental theory that is part of the standard model of 
  particle physics. It is the theory that describes the strong nuclear 
  force, which is one of the fundamental forces of nature.

Generator of Molecules: Generate molecules with random generation
  Molecules research: uses one cross-site of anonchatgpt to make research about the molecule  the button connect/disconnect 
        then if you don't use this the site not make connection
         Molecules Viwer: to reproduce one visualization with the interpretation of formula of your molecule
          IMG > Base64: To convert one image in string base64
          CSV Generator: This generate one .CSV that contain the proprierties of your molecule
          CSV to HTML: This generate with basis in the .CSV one html visualization of proprierties of molecule
