# [Quantum chromodynamics (QCD)](/assets/addons/python/QCD)  
  - Quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
     indeed a fundamental theory that is part of the standard model of 
      particle physics. It is the theory that describes the strong nuclear 
      force, which is one of the fundamental forces of nature.

- [Reactor](/assets/addons/python/Reactor)  
  - This is one project of Digital Reactor that generate multiples equations math,  
     idealy to use to operate reactors with energy calcs,mass and elements study.  
      The molecules generator included is result of one process in the deep of reactor,  
       that generate elements after your operation  
        faciliting the studies and uses of reactors and other nuclear developments.  
# /dev/  
  - Generator of Molecules: Generate molecules with random generation   
     - Molecules research: uses one cross-site of anonchatgpt to make research,   
     - Molecules Viwer: to reproduce one visualization with the interpretation of formula of your molecule  
      - IMG > Base64: To convert one image in string base64  
      - CSV Generator: This generate one .CSV that contain the proprierties of your molecule  
      - CSV to HTML: This generate with basis in the .CSV one html visualization of proprierties of molecule
