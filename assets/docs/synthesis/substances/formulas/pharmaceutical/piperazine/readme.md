# Piperazine C4H10N2  
  is a drug that has the molecular formula C4H10N2.    
   It is an anthelmintic agent used to treat certain types of parasitic worm infections, such as roundworm and pinworm infections.       
    Piperazine works by paralyzing the worms, allowing them to be expelled from the body through bowel movements.     

   Piperazine can be administered orally in the form of tablets or syrup.      
    It is commonly used in both human and veterinary medicine for the treatment of worm infestations.     
     However,      
      it's important to note that the use of piperazine for medical purposes should be under the guidance and prescription of a healthcare professional.       

  Additionally, piperazine has also been used in the past as an anthelmintic agent for animals, particularly for the treatment of parasites in livestock.     
   However,   
    its veterinary use has diminished over the years with the development of newer and more effective medications.     
  
  As with any medication,     
   it's important to follow the prescribed dosage and directions provided by a healthcare professional and     
    to be aware of any potential side effects or drug interactions.
