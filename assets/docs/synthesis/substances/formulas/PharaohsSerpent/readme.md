To create the "Pharaoh's Serpent" reaction using mercury(II) thiocyanate (Hg(SCN)2), follow these steps:

**Materials:**
- Mercury(II) thiocyanate (Hg(SCN)2)
- Heat-resistant surface
- Igniter (lighter or match)
- Safety goggles and gloves
- Adequate ventilation

**Procedure:**
1. **Safety Precautions:** Put on safety goggles and gloves. Perform this experiment in a well-ventilated area, as the reaction produces gases that are not safe to inhale.

2. **Preparation:** Place a small amount of mercury(II) thiocyanate (Hg(SCN)2) onto a heat-resistant surface. A few grams will be sufficient to demonstrate the reaction.

3. **Ignition:** Using an igniter (lighter or match), carefully light the edge of the mercury(II) thiocyanate powder. The powder will start to decompose when heated.

4. **Observation:** As the compound decomposes, it will produce a snake-like structure that rapidly grows outwards. This structure is made of solid materials formed during the decomposition.

5. **Reaction:** The reaction can be represented by the following equation:
   ```
   Hg(SCN)2 â†’ HgS + 2CNS + CS2 + Hg
   ```
   - Hg(SCN)2 decomposes into mercury sulfide (HgS), carbon nitride (CNS), carbon disulfide (CS2), and mercury (Hg).

6. **Cooling:** Allow the reaction products to cool down before handling. The snake-like structure formed during the reaction can be delicate, so be cautious.

Remember that this reaction involves the use of potentially hazardous chemicals and the production of toxic gases. It's important to perform this experiment with proper safety precautions and in a controlled environment. Always prioritize safety and follow guidelines for handling chemicals and conducting experiments.

Please note that the reaction is a chemical one, not a nuclear one, and doesn't involve uranium, plutonium, or nuclear fission. If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask.
