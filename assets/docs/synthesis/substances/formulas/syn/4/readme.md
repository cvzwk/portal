# Methamphetamine = C10H15N, 
   commonly known as meth, is a powerful central nervous system (CNS) stimulant.    
    It belongs to a class of drugs called amphetamines and is chemically similar to amphetamine.   
     Methamphetamine is a highly addictive substance that produces euphoria, increased energy, and heightened focus.    

   Methamphetamine can be consumed in several ways, including oral ingestion, smoking, snorting, or injecting.     
    The drug rapidly enters the brain, where it increases the release and blocks the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin,    
     neurotransmitters associated with pleasure and reward. This results in a powerful and long-lasting stimulant effect.    

  While methamphetamine has limited medical uses for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy,        
   its recreational use is illegal and highly dangerous.     
    Prolonged use of methamphetamine can have severe physical, psychological, and social consequences. These may include:    
  
   1. Physical effects:   
       Increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, decreased appetite, weight loss, dilated pupils,   
        dental problems (commonly known as "meth mouth"), skin sores, and rapid or premature aging.     
   
   2. Psychological effects:   
       Euphoria, increased alertness, intense focus, heightened sexual arousal, irritability, anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations,   
        delusions, aggression, and violent behavior.   
        
   3. Health risks:   
       Chronic methamphetamine use can lead to cardiovascular problems, stroke, liver and kidney damage, respiratory issues,     
        malnutrition, weakened immune system, increased risk of infectious diseases (such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis),     
         and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, and psychosis).    
  
   4. Addiction:    
       Methamphetamine is highly addictive due to its powerful impact on the brain's reward system.       
        Continued use can lead to dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms when trying to quit.

Substances that have the Original formula C13H20N2:   
   - Phenmetrazine is a substance that has the chemical formula C13H20N2.     
      It is a central nervous system stimulant that acts as an appetite suppressant.     
       Phenmetrazine was used in the past as a medication to aid weight loss,     
        but is currently banned in many countries due to its potential for abuse and adverse side effects.     
         Phenmetrazine stimulates the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin,    
          resulting in stimulant and appetite suppressant effects.   
           However, due to the risks associated with its use,  
            phenmetrazine is no longer widely available for medical use and is considered a controlled substance in many countries.
