# Cordite   
is a family of smokeless propellants that was developed and produced in Britain since 1889. It was created to replace black powder as a military firearm propellant. Here are some key points about cordite:

- Cordite is classified as a low explosive due to its slow burning rates.
- It is a propellant of the double-base type, and it is called cordite because of its customary cord-like shape.
- Cordite is composed of nitroglycerin, guncotton, and a petroleum substance, usually gelatinized by the addition of acetone.
- It was invented by Sir Frederick Abel, a British chemist.
- Cordite was used as a military propellant and played a significant role in modernizing ammunition.

--------------------    

- more details about cordite's properties in terms of g/mol:

* Nitroglycerin: 227 g/mol
* Guncotton: 162 g/mol
* Petroleum: 120 g/mol
* Total: 509 g/mol

The molecular weight of cordite is therefore 509 g/mol. This means that 1 mole of cordite will have a mass of 509 grams.

Cordite is a low explosive because it has a slow burning rate. This means that it takes a long time for cordite to ignite and explode. This makes it a safer propellant than black powder, which is a high explosive.

Cordite is also a double-base propellant, which means that it is made up of two different types of nitrocellulose. This gives cordite a higher energy density than other types of propellants.

Cordite was invented by Sir Frederick Abel in 1889. It was first used by the British military in 1891. Cordite quickly became the standard propellant for British firearms and artillery. It is still used by some militaries today.

- Manufacture:
  -Process of Extrusion

The manufacture of Cordite from its component materials was essentially that of combining a fairly stiff paste (nitrocellulose) with an oily liquid (nitroglycerine) and converting the resultant material into the appropriate form.
In the early days of RNCF the mixing was done with the aid of a solvent, acetone. The mixing was carried out in an “incorporator house” where the components were thoroughly mixed and then passed to “press houses” for extrusion into rods of various diameters depending upon the size of   

shell the material was destined for. The presses were hydraulically operated and were fitted with interchangeable heads for the different sizes of Cordite.
The extruded Cordite was then laid in slatted drying trays through which warm air could be passed to drive off the acetone solvent. Finally     
the rods or cords were “gauged” or cut to length and carefully aligned, wrapped and packed in boxes and dispatched to the filling factories. RNCF was only concerned with the manufacture of propellant and never involved in the shell filling process.
In later years the manufacture was altered slightly by producing the nitrocellulose in the form of a slurry which could be pumped to the incorporator houses and which removed the need for any additional solvent to aid mixing.

----------------------     

Cordite is a type of smokeless propellant that was invented in the late 19th century. It is made from a mixture of nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, and stabilizers. Cordite can be extruded into a variety of shapes, including rods, tubes, and cartridges.

The extrusion process for cordite is similar to the extrusion process for other materials. The first step is to prepare the ingredients. The nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin are mixed together in a specific ratio. The stabilizers are then added, and the mixture is heated until it is melted.

The molten mixture is then fed into an extruder. The extruder is a machine that has a barrel and a screw. The barrel is heated, and the screw rotates. The screw forces the molten mixture through a die. The die is a metal block that has a specific cross-sectional shape. The extruded cordite takes on the shape of the die.

The extruded cordite is then cooled. This can be done by air cooling or by water cooling. The cooled cordite can then be cut to the desired length.

The extrusion process for cordite is a relatively simple process. However, it is important to follow safety guidelines when extruding cordite. Cordite is a flammable material, and it can be dangerous if it is not handled properly.

Here are some safety guidelines for extruding cordite:

* Always wear safety glasses and gloves when extruding cordite.
* Do not extrude cordite in an area where there is a fire hazard.
* Keep the extruder clean and free of debris.
* Do not extrude cordite if it is not the correct temperature.
* Do not extrude cordite if it is not the correct consistency.

-------------------------     

* **Ingredients:** Cordite is made from a mixture of nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, and stabilizers. The specific proportions of these ingredients vary depending on the type of cordite being manufactured.
* **Preparation:** The nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin are mixed together in a specific ratio. The stabilizers are then added, and the mixture is heated until it is melted. The mixture is then cooled to a temperature that is still liquid but not too hot.
* **Extrusion:** The molten mixture is then fed into an extruder. The extruder is a machine that has a barrel and a screw. The barrel is heated, and the screw rotates. The screw forces the molten mixture through a die. The die is a metal block that has a specific cross-sectional shape. The extruded cordite takes on the shape of the die.
* **Cooling:** The extruded cordite is then cooled. This can be done by air cooling or by water cooling. The cooled cordite can then be cut to the desired length.
* **Sizing:** The cooled cordite may then be sized to the desired dimensions. This can be done by cutting, trimming, or grinding.
* **Packaging:** The cordite is then packaged in containers that are suitable for its intended use.

Here are some additional details about the extrusion process for cordite:

* The barrel of the extruder is typically heated to a temperature of between 200 and 300 degrees Celsius.
* The screw of the extruder rotates at a speed of between 100 and 200 revolutions per minute.
* The die of the extruder is typically made of steel or brass.
* The cross-sectional shape of the die can be varied to produce different shapes of cordite.
* The extruded cordite is typically cooled by air cooling.
* The cooled cordite is typically cut to the desired length using a saw or a cutting machine.

The extrusion process for cordite is a versatile process that can be used to produce a variety of shapes and sizes of cordite. The process is relatively simple and efficient, and it can be used to produce cordite that is consistent in quality.   

-------------------------     

The amount of each element or ingredient during the manufacture of cordite is determined by a variety of factors, including the desired properties of the cordite, the manufacturing process, and the availability of raw materials.

The following are some of the factors that are considered when determining the amount of each element or ingredient in cordite:

* **The desired properties of the cordite:** The properties of the cordite, such as its burning rate, flame velocity, and specific impulse, are determined by the amount of each element or ingredient in the cordite. For example, a higher proportion of nitroglycerin will result in a cordite with a faster burning rate.
* **The manufacturing process:** The manufacturing process also affects the amount of each element or ingredient in cordite. For example, a different amount of nitrocellulose may be required if the cordite is being extruded or cast.
* **The availability of raw materials:** The availability of raw materials also affects the amount of each element or ingredient in cordite. For example, if nitroglycerin is not available, it may be necessary to use a different propellant.

The amount of each element or ingredient in cordite is typically determined by trial and error. A variety of different compositions are tested until the desired properties are achieved.

It is important to note that the amount of each element or ingredient in cordite is critical. If the amount of an element or ingredient is too high or too low, the cordite may not function properly. For example, if the amount of nitroglycerin is too high, the cordite may detonate too quickly. If the amount of nitroglycerin is too low, the cordite may not have enough power.

The determination of the amount of each element or ingredient in cordite is a complex process that requires a thorough understanding of the properties of the cordite and the manufacturing process. It is important to consult with a qualified engineer or scientist when determining the amount of each element or ingredient in cordite.

* **Colorants:** Colorants are added to cordite to make it easier to identify. They typically make up around 0.1-0.5% of the charge.
* **Other ingredients:** Other ingredients, such as stabilizers, plasticizers, and colorants, may also be added to cordite to improve its properties. The amount of these ingredients will vary depending on the specific type of cordite being manufactured.

It is important to note that the amount of each element or ingredient in a 500g cordite charge is critical. If the amount of an element or ingredient is too high or too low, the cordite may not function properly. For example, if the amount of nitroglycerin is too high, the cordite may detonate too quickly. If the amount of nitroglycerin is too low, the cordite may not have enough power.

# Variables of Manufacture:   

The extrusion process for cordite is a complex process that involves a number of variables. Some of the most important variables include:

* **The temperature of the barrel:** The temperature of the barrel determines the viscosity of the molten mixture. A higher temperature will result in a lower viscosity, which will make it easier to extrude the cordite.
* **The speed of the screw:** The speed of the screw determines the amount of pressure that is applied to the molten mixture. A higher speed will result in a higher pressure, which will make it easier to extrude the cordite.
* **The cross-sectional shape of the die:** The cross-sectional shape of the die determines the shape of the extruded cordite.
* **The length of the die:** The length of the die determines the length of the extruded cordite.
* **The cooling rate:** The cooling rate determines the final properties of the extruded cordite. A slower cooling rate will result in a cordite that is more brittle, while a faster cooling rate will result in a cordite that is more flexible.

The following equation can be used to calculate the extrusion pressure for cordite:

```
P = K * ln (R) + C
```

where:

* P is the extrusion pressure (MPa)
* K is a constant that depends on the material being extruded
* ln (R) is the natural logarithm of the extrusion ratio
* R is the extrusion ratio, which is the ratio of the initial cross-sectional area of the molten mixture to the final cross-sectional area of the extruded cordite
* C is a constant that depends on the die geometry

The extrusion pressure is a critical factor in the extrusion process. If the extrusion pressure is too low, the molten mixture will not be able to flow through the die. If the extrusion pressure is too high, the molten mixture will be squeezed out of the die too quickly, which can result in defects in the extruded cordite.

The extrusion process for cordite is a complex process that involves a number of variables. By understanding these variables, you can help to ensure that the extrusion process is carried out safely and efficiently.
