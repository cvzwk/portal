# Cordite   
is a family of smokeless propellants that was developed and produced in Britain since 1889. It was created to replace black powder as a military firearm propellant. Here are some key points about cordite:

- Cordite is classified as a low explosive due to its slow burning rates.
- It is a propellant of the double-base type, and it is called cordite because of its customary cord-like shape.
- Cordite is composed of nitroglycerin, guncotton, and a petroleum substance, usually gelatinized by the addition of acetone.
- It was invented by Sir Frederick Abel, a British chemist.
- Cordite was used as a military propellant and played a significant role in modernizing ammunition.

- more details about cordite's properties in terms of g/mol:

* Nitroglycerin: 227 g/mol
* Guncotton: 162 g/mol
* Petroleum: 120 g/mol
* Total: 509 g/mol

The molecular weight of cordite is therefore 509 g/mol. This means that 1 mole of cordite will have a mass of 509 grams.

Cordite is a low explosive because it has a slow burning rate. This means that it takes a long time for cordite to ignite and explode. This makes it a safer propellant than black powder, which is a high explosive.

Cordite is also a double-base propellant, which means that it is made up of two different types of nitrocellulose. This gives cordite a higher energy density than other types of propellants.

Cordite was invented by Sir Frederick Abel in 1889. It was first used by the British military in 1891. Cordite quickly became the standard propellant for British firearms and artillery. It is still used by some militaries today.
