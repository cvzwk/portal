To create one molecule of bismuth hydroxide (Bi(OH)3),  
 you would need to combine one bismuth ion (Bi3+) with three hydroxide ions (OH-).    
  Here's the balanced chemical equation for the formation of bismuth hydroxide:  
    
    Bi3+ + 3OH- â†’ Bi(OH)3

  To create the molecule, you would typically start with a soluble bismuth salt,    
   such as bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3) or bismuth chloride (BiCl3),   
    and then add a source of hydroxide ions, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH).    
     The reaction between the bismuth salt and the hydroxide ions would result in the formation of bismuth hydroxide.   

  It's important to note that bismuth hydroxide is not commonly encountered as a stable compound in its pure form,    
   and it tends to undergo further reactions or transformations in the presence of water or other substances.

bismuth-tin (or Wood's alloy).
This alloy has the property of expanding upon solidification, making it useful in applications such as low-melting solder,  
 thermal safety devices, and sprinkler valves.
