# Alkalis 
  - are substances that produce alkaline or basic solutions when dissolved in water.

  These are additional examples of elements and compounds that can produce alkaline solutions.      
   It's important to note that the strength of the base and the concentration of the solution can affect the degree of alkalinity.   

   These elements, when combined with hydroxide ions, produce alkaline solutions.      
    It's important to note that alkalis can be corrosive and should be handled with caution.
