# Yellow Fever

- Yellow fever is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes that bite mostly during the day[2][5][6]. It is a high-impact, high-threat disease that represents a potential threat to global health security[2][5]. Here are some key points about yellow fever:

- **Symptoms**: Most people infected with the yellow fever virus do not get sick or have only mild symptoms. However, in some cases, the illness can range from a fever with aches and pains to severe liver disease with bleeding[1][3][6].

- **Transmission**: Yellow fever is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. There are three types of transmission cycles: domestic (mosquitoes breed around houses), wild (mosquitoes breed in forests or jungles), and semi-domestic (mosquitoes breed in both habitats) [5][6].

- **Prevention**: Yellow fever is preventable with a vaccine. Vaccination is recommended for travelers to areas where yellow fever is endemic or where there is a risk of transmission[3][5].

It's important to note that yellow fever is a very rare cause of illness in U.S. travelers[1]. If you have any concerns about yellow fever or travel to areas where it is prevalent, it is best to consult with a healthcare professional or refer to official sources such as the CDC or WHO for the most up-to-date information and recommendations.

# The yellow fever virus proteins

Here are the known proteins of the yellow fever virus:  

1. **Capsid**: This protein forms the outer shell of the virus and protects its genetic material.

2. **prM**: The precursor to the M protein, it helps in the assembly of the viral particle.

3. **Envelope (E)**: This protein is responsible for the attachment of the virus to host cells and the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane.

4. **Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)**: NS1 is involved in viral replication and immune evasion.

5. **Nonstructural protein 2A (NS2A)**: NS2A plays a role in viral replication and assembly.

6. **Nonstructural protein 2B (NS2B)**: NS2B is a cofactor for the NS3 proteinase, which is involved in viral polyprotein processing.

7. **Nonstructural protein 3 (NS3)**: NS3 has multiple functions, including viral replication, polyprotein processing, and immune evasion.

8. **Nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A)**: NS4A is involved in viral replication and assembly.

9. **Nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B)**: NS4B plays a role in viral replication and immune evasion.

10. **Nonstructural protein 5 (NS5)**: NS5 is the largest protein of the yellow fever virus and is involved in viral replication and immune evasion.

These proteins work together to facilitate the replication and spread of the yellow fever virus within the host. Further research is ongoing to better understand the functions and interactions of these proteins in the context of yellow fever infection.

- The amino acid sequence of yellow fever virus:  
   The virus has a single long open reading frame of 10,233 nucleotides, which could encode a polypeptide of 3411 amino acids.
    The structural proteins are found within the amino-terminal 780 residues of this polyprotein, while the remainder of the open reading frame consists of nonstructural viral polypeptides.
     The capsid protein of the virus is quite basic, containing about 25 percent lysine and arginine distributed throughout the protein.  
      The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the 27-kDa protein indicates that the N-terminus of YF NS4B immediately follows a signalase-like cleavage site.
