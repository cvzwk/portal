# Tuna
 is a type of fish that is known for being a good source of protein and essential nutrients.    
  While the exact amino acid composition of tuna may vary slightly depending on factors such as the species of tuna and its diet,        
   here are the amino acids commonly found in tuna:    

1. Alanine
2. Arginine
3. Asparagine
4. Aspartic acid
5. Cysteine
6. Glutamic acid
7. Glutamine
8. Glycine
9. Histidine
10. Isoleucine
11. Leucine
12. Lysine
13. Methionine
14. Phenylalanine
15. Proline
16. Serine
17. Threonine
18. Tryptophan
19. Tyrosine
20. Valine

Tuna is considered a high-quality protein source because it contains all essential amino acids,      
 which are amino acids that the body cannot produce on its own and must be obtained through the diet.    

Additionally, tuna is particularly rich in certain amino acids such as lysine, histidine, and leucine.      
 These amino acids play important roles in protein synthesis, tissue repair,       
  immune function, and various other physiological processes in the body.  

Remember that the nutritional composition of tuna, including amino acids,    
 can vary depending on factors such as the specific species of tuna, its diet, and the cooking or preparation method.
