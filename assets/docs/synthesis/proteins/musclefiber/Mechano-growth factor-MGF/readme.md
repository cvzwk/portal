# Mechano-growth factor (MGF)
  is an isoform of the hormone IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1) that is involved in muscle growth and regeneration.    
   The MGF protein is derived from alternative splicing of the IGF-1 gene and contains an additional amino acid sequence known as   
    the mechanical growth factor activation domain.    


The amino acid sequence of the MGF protein is as follows:   
Met-Arg-Thr-Ser-Glu-Lys-Ser-Gln-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Glu-Val-Leu-Cys-Gly-Asp-Ala-Leu-Val-Gly-Gly-Lys-Leu-Ser-Ala-Lys-Leu-Leu-Gln-Phe-Val-Ile-Gly-Glu-Glu-Leu-Ala-Lys-Gly-Ile-Val-Ile-Leu-Lys-Gly-Lys-Lys-Leu-Glu-Lys-Phe-Asp-Ile-Gly-Ile-Glu-Leu-Arg-Leu-Leu-Gln-Gln-Asp-Gly-Lys-Thr-Thr-Ile-Ser-Asn-Leu-Lys-Leu-Gln-Gln-Gly-Ile-Arg-Val-Phe-Ile-Arg-Glu-Gln-Glu-Gly-Leu-Leu-Glu-Leu-Leu-Lys-Lys-Asp-Lys-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Glu-Lys-Leu-Gly-Lys-Leu-Leu-Lys-Leu-Gly-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu-Leu-Glu-Lys-Lys-Leu-Ala-Gln-Ala-Arg-Leu-Lys-Arg-Ile-Arg-Gln-Ser-Thr-Gly-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ala-Ala-Gln-Lys-Val-Ala-Gly-Asp-Thr-Arg-Thr-Arg-Ala-Leu-Gly-Thr-Leu-Lys-Asn-Gly-Leu-Gly-Glu-Glu-Thr-Ser-Ala-Gly-Gly-Ala-Glu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Leu-Ala-Leu-Arg-Leu-Leu-Gln-Lys-Ala-Gln-Gly-Thr-Gly-Ala-Glu-Ile-Ala-Ala-Gln-Thr-Ala-Thr-Leu-Ala-Leu-Leu-Leu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Leu-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Glu-Gln-Gly-Glu-Thr-Glu-Leu-Ala-Arg-Leu-Ala-Glu-Gly-Gly-Gly-Thr-Gly-Asp-Ala-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gly-Thr-Thr-Glu-Thr-Gln-Leu-Ala-Gln-Gly-Gly-Glu-Asp-Thr-Ala-Thr-Gln-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Thr-Ala-Gln-Leu-Gly-Gly-Glu-Ala-Ala-Glu-Gly-Thr-Thr-Gly-Thr-Gly-Leu-Gly-Glu-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gly-Asp-Ala-Glu-Leu-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu-Ala-Glu-Gln-Gly-Thr-Gly-Glu-Thr-Glu-Glu-Thr-Gly-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Thr-Gly-Thr-Glu-Gly-Gly-Gly-Thr-Glu-Thr-Gly-Glu-Leu-Leu-Gly-Gly-Glu-Glu
