The process of mixture involving N-(1-(2-phenethyl)-4-piperidinyl-N-phenyl-propanamide can be summarized as follows:

1. Synthesis of N-(1-(2-phenethyl)-4-piperidinyl-N-phenyl-propanamide: This compound can be synthesized through a multi-step organic synthesis process. The exact steps and reagents used may vary depending on the specific synthetic route chosen.

The possible synthetic route:

1. Start with commercially available starting materials: The synthesis may begin with commercially available starting materials, such as phenethylamine, piperidine, and phenylacetic acid.

2. Protecting groups: If necessary, protecting groups may be used to protect certain functional groups on the starting materials from unwanted reactions. This step can help control the selectivity of subsequent reactions.

3. Formation of intermediates: The first steps of the synthesis may involve the transformation of the starting materials into key intermediates through various reactions. Common reactions used in the synthesis of amides include amidation, coupling reactions, and condensation reactions.

4. Derivatization: Functional groups on the intermediates may need to be modified or derivatized to introduce the desired substituents. Reactions such as bromination, methylation, or acylation may be involved in this step.

5. Final coupling: The key intermediates are then coupled together to form the final compound. This is typically achieved using coupling reagents such as DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) or EDC (ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide).

6. Deprotection: If any protecting groups were used earlier to protect certain functional groups, they are removed in this step. This can involve various deprotection reagents and conditions specific to the protecting group used.

7. Purification: After the synthesis is complete, the crude product is purified using techniques such as column chromatography, recrystallization, or liquid-liquid extraction to obtain a pure sample of N-(1-(2-phenethyl)-4-piperidinyl-N-phenyl-propanamide.

2. Purification: Once the compound is synthesized, it needs to be purified to remove any impurities that may be present. This step typically involves techniques such as recrystallization, column chromatography, or liquid-liquid extraction.

Various purification techniques can be utilized, including:

1. Recrystallization: This method involves dissolving the crude compound in a suitable solvent at an elevated temperature to form a concentrated solution. The solution is then slowly cooled to induce crystallization. The resulting crystals are collected, washed with a cold solvent, and dried to obtain pure N-(1-(2-phenethyl)-4-piperidinyl-N-phenyl-propanamide.

2. Column chromatography: This technique involves passing the crude compound mixture through a column packed with a stationary phase, such as silica gel or an adsorbent resin. By varying the composition of the mobile phase (solvent system), different compounds in the mixture can be selectively eluted. Fractions containing the desired compound are collected, combined, and evaporated to obtain purified N-(1-(2-phenethyl)-4-piperidinyl-N-phenyl-propanamide.

3. Liquid-liquid extraction: In this method, the crude compound is dissolved in a suitable solvent, and then another solvent (often immiscible with the first solvent) is added. The two solvents are mixed, and the impurities selectively partition into one of the solvents while the desired compound remains in the other. The two solvent phases are separated, and the desired compound is isolated either by evaporating the solvent or carrying out further purification steps.

Depending on the nature of impurities and the desired purity level, a combination of these techniques may be employed in the purification process. The choice of the specific purification technique(s) will depend on factors such as the solubility of the compound and impurities, the availability of solvents, and the scale of the purification required. Additionally, analytical techniques like thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and spectroscopic methods can be employed to monitor the purification process and assess the purity of the compound.
