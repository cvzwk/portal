# J. Robert Oppenheimer 
- (April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967)
   was an American theoretical physicist and the director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. He is often called the "father of the atomic bomb".

Oppenheimer was born in New York City to Jewish immigrants from Germany. He studied at Harvard University, where he received a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1925 and a doctorate in physics in 1927. He then went on to study at the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he worked with Max Born.

In 1930, Oppenheimer returned to the United States and joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley. He quickly became one of the leading physicists in the world, and he played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.

In 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan Project, which was the secret project to develop the atomic bomb. He led the project with great skill and determination, and the first atomic bomb was successfully tested in July 1945.

After the war, Oppenheimer became a leading critic of the development of nuclear weapons. He warned that the use of nuclear weapons could lead to the destruction of civilization, and he called for a ban on nuclear testing.

Oppenheimer was a complex and controversial figure. He was brilliant, charismatic, and dedicated to his work. However, he was also troubled by the consequences of his work on the atomic bomb, and he suffered from depression for many years.

Oppenheimer died in 1967 at the age of 62. He is remembered as one of the most important physicists of the 20th century, and his legacy continues to be debated today.

# The Oppenheimer equations   
 are a set of partial differential equations that describe the electronic motion of a molecule under the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. The equations are a product of two terms, one for the kinetic energy of the electrons and one for the potential energy of the electrons. The potential energy term includes the Coulomb interaction between the electrons and the nuclei, as well as the electron–electron interaction.

The Oppenheimer equations are given by:

$H_e$ = $-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} \nabla^2_e$ + $V_{ee}$ + $V_{en}$

where:

* $H_e$ is the electronic Hamiltonian
* $-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} \nabla^2_e$ is the kinetic energy operator for the electrons
* $V_{ee}$ is the electron–electron interaction
* $V_{en}$ is the electron–nucleus interaction
* $m_e$ is the mass of an electron
* $\hbar$ is Planck's constant
* $\nabla^2_e$ is the Laplacian operator for the electrons

The Oppenheimer equations are difficult to solve analytically, but they can be solved numerically using a variety of methods. The solutions to the Oppenheimer equations give the energy levels and wavefunctions of the molecule.

Here are some of the key features of the Oppenheimer equations:

* The equations are a product of two terms, one for the kinetic energy of the electrons and one for the potential energy of the electrons.
* The potential energy term includes the Coulomb interaction between the electrons and the nuclei, as well as the electron–electron interaction.
* The equations are difficult to solve analytically, but they can be solved numerically using a variety of methods.
* The solutions to the equations give the energy levels and wavefunctions of the molecule.

The Oppenheimer equations are an important tool in molecular quantum mechanics. They allow us to understand the electronic structure of molecules and to calculate their spectroscopic properties.
