# My Stuff Of Scripts To Interact With .50    

- Angle Script to fire at long ranges: [Angle.py](/assets/docs/knowledges/weapons/sniper/.50/py/angle.py)
- Example Of Result:
Enter the target distance (meters): 2500     
Enter the projectile mass (kg): 1     
Enter the initial velocity (m/s): 955      
The firing angle to hit the target at 2500.0 meters is approximately 0.77 degrees

- How I can obtain the distance until target using Scope?

Thinking i reached in an conclusion of establish one concept of how take one approximately distance of target using only scope.

Good, my first think is use the size that the target represent between the mili dots of scope over and below.

example: Using Scope that reach in 15km
15 Mili Dots are ploted in the scope representing 1km each

after study one target that your position is knowed i take the size that he represent between the mili dots. then i take one think that between the first over and bottom mili dot the target represent 700meters

then multiplying the distance and reducing the size of target representation between the mili dots i can take the approximate distance of shoot
