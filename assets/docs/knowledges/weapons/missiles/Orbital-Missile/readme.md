- Orbital Period Of Missile:
Sure, let's consider an example using a simplified scenario.

Imagine a missile launched from the surface of Earth with an initial velocity of 8 km/s (kilometers per second). We'll assume that the missile is launched horizontally and neglect air resistance. The gravitational acceleration on Earth's surface is approximately 9.81 m/s².

To calculate the missile's orbital period, we'll need to find its orbital altitude first. The formula for the altitude of a circular orbit is given by:

Altitude = (Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth) / (Orbital Velocity²) - Radius of Earth

Given the values:             
- Gravitational Constant (G) = 6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s²
- Mass of Earth = 5.972 × 10^24 kg
- Radius of Earth = 6.371 × 10^6 m

Plugging in the values and solving for altitude:          
Altitude = (6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (8,000 m/s)² - 6.371 × 10^6 m
Altitude ≈ 21,200,000 meters or 21,200 km

Now that we have the orbital altitude, we can use Kepler's third law to calculate the orbital period:

Orbital Period = 2 * π * (Orbital Radius)^(3/2) / √(Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth)

Plugging in the values and solving for orbital period:                
Orbital Period = 2 * π * (21,200,000 m)^(3/2) / √(6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg)
Orbital Period ≈ 1,251 minutes or 20.85 hours

This calculation gives us an approximate orbital period of 20.85 hours for the missile.

Please note that this is a simplified example and doesn't take into account many real-world factors, such as the missile's changing altitude due to atmospheric drag and the complexities of orbital dynamics.

- Speed Velocity Of Missile:                 
To calculate the speed of a missile in orbit using the given equation, you can rearrange the formula to solve for the orbital velocity. The formula for orbital velocity is given by:

Orbital Velocity = √((Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth) / (Orbital Radius))

Given the values:          
- Gravitational Constant (G) = 6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s²
- Mass of Earth = 5.972 × 10^24 kg
- Orbital Radius (altitude) = 21,200,000 meters

Plugging in the values and solving for orbital velocity:         
Orbital Velocity = √((6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (21,200,000 m))
Orbital Velocity ≈ 7,900 m/s (meters per second)

So, the orbital velocity of the missile in this scenario would be approximately 7,900 meters per second. This is the speed at which the missile needs to travel horizontally in order to maintain a circular orbit at the given altitude. Keep in mind that this calculation assumes ideal conditions and neglects various factors such as air resistance and the missile's launch angle.

- Time of reach in one point:       
Sure, let's create a simplified example where a missile is launched from Brazil and targets a point in Antarctica. We'll assume that the missile's trajectory is such that it reaches the desired orbital altitude over Antarctica.

1. Desired Orbital Altitude: Let's assume you want the missile to enter a low Earth orbit at an altitude of 200 km (200,000 meters).

2. Orbital Velocity: Using the formula for orbital velocity, we calculate the speed the missile needs to achieve for the desired altitude:

   Orbital Velocity = √((Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth) / (Orbital Radius))
   Orbital Velocity = √((6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (200,000 m))
   Orbital Velocity ≈ 7,905 m/s

3. Launch and Reach: The missile's launch velocity will be around 7,905 m/s. Now, let's calculate the time it takes for the missile to reach the desired altitude using the kinematic equation:

   Time of Reach = (Final Velocity - Initial Velocity) / Acceleration

   Since the missile's speed at the peak of its trajectory is 0 m/s, and acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s²:
   
   Time of Reach = (0 - 7,905 m/s) / (-9.81 m/s²)
   Time of Reach ≈ 804 seconds or 13.4 minutes

In this example, the missile would need to reach a launch velocity of approximately 7,905 m/s to enter a low Earth orbit at an altitude of 200 km over Antarctica. It would take around 13.4 minutes for the missile to reach this altitude. Keep in mind that this example doesn't account for real-world factors such as air resistance, the Earth's rotation, and the precise trajectory required to hit a specific point in Antarctica. Actual launch scenarios involve complex calculations and considerations.

- Adjusting to 45secs:         
To reach the target in 45 seconds, you would need to make significant adjustments to the missile's launch parameters, including the launch velocity and the desired orbital altitude. Keep in mind that achieving such a short time of reach would require extremely high speeds and significant challenges.

Let's work through a hypothetical scenario where the missile is launched from Brazil to reach the target in 45 seconds. We'll adjust the orbital altitude to make the calculations more feasible:

1. Desired Time of Reach: You want the missile to reach the target in 45 seconds.

2. Adjusted Orbital Altitude: Given the short time frame, you'll need to aim for a very low Earth orbit. Let's choose an altitude of 100 km (100,000 meters).

3. Orbital Velocity: Using the formula for orbital velocity, calculate the new speed required for the adjusted altitude:       

   Orbital Velocity = √((Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth) / (Orbital Radius))
   Orbital Velocity = √((6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (100,000 m))
   Orbital Velocity ≈ 10,733 m/s

4. Launch and Reach: The missile's launch velocity would need to be around 10,733 m/s to reach the desired orbital altitude of 100 km within 45 seconds.

Please note that achieving such high launch velocities and short time frames is far beyond the capabilities of current technology. The tremendous energy requirements, technological challenges, and safety concerns associated with such rapid acceleration make this scenario purely hypothetical and speculative.

Additionally, launching missiles with such high speeds and short time frames poses significant risks and potential consequences. It's crucial to approach space-related activities responsibly and adhere to international regulations and ethical considerations.

- 21 Secs:            
Reaching a target in just 21 seconds would require even more extreme adjustments to the missile's parameters. Achieving such high speeds in a short time frame is exceedingly challenging and far beyond current technological capabilities. However, let's proceed with a hypothetical example to demonstrate the calculations:

1. Desired Time of Reach: You want the missile to reach the target in 21 seconds.

2. Adjusted Orbital Altitude: Given the extremely short time frame, let's choose an even lower orbital altitude of 50 km (50,000 meters).

3. Orbital Velocity: Using the formula for orbital velocity, calculate the new speed required for the adjusted altitude:

   Orbital Velocity = √((Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth) / (Orbital Radius))
   Orbital Velocity = √((6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (50,000 m))
   Orbital Velocity ≈ 15,105 m/s

4. Launch and Reach: The missile's launch velocity would need to be around 15,105 m/s to reach the desired orbital altitude of 50 km within 21 seconds.

It's essential to emphasize that achieving such velocities and short time frames is currently beyond our technological capabilities due to the immense energy requirements, engineering challenges, and potential risks involved. This scenario remains highly speculative and is provided purely for illustrative purposes. Responsible and safe space exploration is of paramount importance, and any real-world endeavors should be undertaken with careful consideration of ethical, legal, and technical factors.

- Weight vs Acceleration / Speed:                           
To achieve the extreme speeds required to reach a target in just 21 seconds, a missile would need an enormous amount of energy and an extremely powerful propulsion system. Given the hypothetical scenario and the weight constraint of 525 kg, let's explore the concept of a purely speculative propulsion system: a nuclear thermal rocket.

Nuclear thermal rockets use a nuclear reactor to heat a propellant (such as hydrogen) to high temperatures, which then expands through a nozzle to generate thrust. This type of propulsion could potentially provide the high thrust and efficiency required for rapid acceleration.

In this example, we'll make several simplifications and assumptions for illustrative purposes:

1. Propulsion: Assume a highly efficient nuclear thermal rocket system with a specific impulse (a measure of propulsion efficiency) of around 1,000 seconds.

2. Thrust-to-Weight Ratio: Let's assume a very high thrust-to-weight ratio of 10, meaning the rocket's thrust is ten times its own weight.

3. Acceleration: Given the thrust-to-weight ratio and mass of 525 kg, the rocket's acceleration would be 525 * 10 = 5250 m/s².

4. Distance Traveled: In 21 seconds, the missile would travel a distance of (1/2) * acceleration * time^2 = 0.5 * 5250 * 21^2 ≈ 228,915 meters (or about 229 km).

To calculate the velocity achieved using this acceleration, you can use the equation:

Velocity = Initial Velocity + (Acceleration * Time)

Since the initial velocity is 0 m/s:      

Velocity = 0 + (5250 m/s² * 21 s) = 110,250 m/s

It's important to emphasize that these calculations are based on hypothetical and speculative scenarios. The engineering challenges, safety concerns, and ethical considerations associated with such rapid acceleration and nuclear propulsion are substantial and go beyond the scope of this discussion.

Furthermore, this scenario does not consider the complexities of real-world rocket designs, the operational challenges, or the potential environmental and safety risks associated with the use of nuclear propulsion. Responsible space exploration and propulsion technology development require careful consideration, rigorous testing, and adherence to international regulations.

- Calculating the amount of fuel to transport certain weight total:

 let's make a simplified example using the last adjusted scenario: launching a missile with a weight of 525 kg to reach a target in 21 seconds with an orbital velocity of 15,105 m/s and an altitude of 50 km.

To calculate the required propellant mass, we'll use the rocket equation, which relates the change in velocity (delta-v), the initial mass of the rocket (including propellant), and the effective exhaust velocity (specific impulse) of the rocket engine:

$\[ \Delta v = v_e \ln \left( \frac{m_i}{m_f} \right) \]$

Where:
- $\(\Delta v\)$ = Change in velocity (15,105 m/s in this case)
- $\(v_e\)$ = Effective exhaust velocity (specific impulse)
- $\(m_i\)$ = Initial mass of the rocket (including propellant)
- $\(m_f\)$ = Final mass of the rocket (after propellant is expended)

Given that we want to reach an orbital velocity of 15,105 m/s and the missile's weight is 525 kg:

Effective exhaust velocity (specific impulse) varies based on the type of rocket engine and fuel used. For simplicity, let's assume an effective exhaust velocity of $\(2,500 m/s\)$ (typical of solid rocket motors). Also, the final mass $(\(m_f\))$ after expending all the propellant would be the missile's weight $(\(525 kg\))$.

Now we can rearrange the rocket equation to solve for the initial mass $(\(m_i\))$:

$\[ m_i = m_f \cdot e^{\frac{\Delta v}{v_e}} \]$

Plugging in the values:
$\[ m_i = 525 \, \text{kg} \cdot e^{\frac{15,105 \, \text{m/s}}{2,500 \, \text{m/s}}} \]$

Solving for $\(m_i\)$:
$\[ m_i \approx 114,374 \, \text{kg} \]$

The calculated initial mass of the rocket, including the propellant, would be approximately $\(114,374\)$ kg. This is significantly greater than the missile's weight of $\(525\)$ kg, highlighting the substantial amount of propellant needed to achieve such high speeds in a short time frame.

Please note that this example uses simplified values and assumptions for the specific impulse and exhaust velocity, and it doesn't consider practical limitations, engineering challenges, or the complexities of real-world rocket systems.
