- Orbital Period Of Missile:
Sure, let's consider an example using a simplified scenario.

Imagine a missile launched from the surface of Earth with an initial velocity of 8 km/s (kilometers per second). We'll assume that the missile is launched horizontally and neglect air resistance. The gravitational acceleration on Earth's surface is approximately 9.81 m/s².

To calculate the missile's orbital period, we'll need to find its orbital altitude first. The formula for the altitude of a circular orbit is given by:

Altitude = (Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth) / (Orbital Velocity²) - Radius of Earth

Given the values:
- Gravitational Constant (G) = 6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s²
- Mass of Earth = 5.972 × 10^24 kg
- Radius of Earth = 6.371 × 10^6 m

Plugging in the values and solving for altitude:
Altitude = (6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (8,000 m/s)² - 6.371 × 10^6 m
Altitude ≈ 21,200,000 meters or 21,200 km

Now that we have the orbital altitude, we can use Kepler's third law to calculate the orbital period:

Orbital Period = 2 * π * (Orbital Radius)^(3/2) / √(Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth)

Plugging in the values and solving for orbital period:
Orbital Period = 2 * π * (21,200,000 m)^(3/2) / √(6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg)
Orbital Period ≈ 1,251 minutes or 20.85 hours

This calculation gives us an approximate orbital period of 20.85 hours for the missile.

Please note that this is a simplified example and doesn't take into account many real-world factors, such as the missile's changing altitude due to atmospheric drag and the complexities of orbital dynamics.
