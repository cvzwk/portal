- Orbital Period Of Missile:
Sure, let's consider an example using a simplified scenario.

Imagine a missile launched from the surface of Earth with an initial velocity of 8 km/s (kilometers per second). We'll assume that the missile is launched horizontally and neglect air resistance. The gravitational acceleration on Earth's surface is approximately 9.81 m/s².

To calculate the missile's orbital period, we'll need to find its orbital altitude first. The formula for the altitude of a circular orbit is given by:

Altitude = (Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth) / (Orbital Velocity²) - Radius of Earth

Given the values:
- Gravitational Constant (G) = 6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s²
- Mass of Earth = 5.972 × 10^24 kg
- Radius of Earth = 6.371 × 10^6 m

Plugging in the values and solving for altitude:
Altitude = (6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (8,000 m/s)² - 6.371 × 10^6 m
Altitude ≈ 21,200,000 meters or 21,200 km

Now that we have the orbital altitude, we can use Kepler's third law to calculate the orbital period:

Orbital Period = 2 * π * (Orbital Radius)^(3/2) / √(Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth)

Plugging in the values and solving for orbital period:
Orbital Period = 2 * π * (21,200,000 m)^(3/2) / √(6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg)
Orbital Period ≈ 1,251 minutes or 20.85 hours

This calculation gives us an approximate orbital period of 20.85 hours for the missile.

Please note that this is a simplified example and doesn't take into account many real-world factors, such as the missile's changing altitude due to atmospheric drag and the complexities of orbital dynamics.

- Speed Velocity Of Missile:
To calculate the speed of a missile in orbit using the given equation, you can rearrange the formula to solve for the orbital velocity. The formula for orbital velocity is given by:

Orbital Velocity = √((Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth) / (Orbital Radius))

Given the values:
- Gravitational Constant (G) = 6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s²
- Mass of Earth = 5.972 × 10^24 kg
- Orbital Radius (altitude) = 21,200,000 meters

Plugging in the values and solving for orbital velocity:
Orbital Velocity = √((6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (21,200,000 m))
Orbital Velocity ≈ 7,900 m/s (meters per second)

So, the orbital velocity of the missile in this scenario would be approximately 7,900 meters per second. This is the speed at which the missile needs to travel horizontally in order to maintain a circular orbit at the given altitude. Keep in mind that this calculation assumes ideal conditions and neglects various factors such as air resistance and the missile's launch angle.

- Time of reach in one point:
Sure, let's create a simplified example where a missile is launched from Brazil and targets a point in Antarctica. We'll assume that the missile's trajectory is such that it reaches the desired orbital altitude over Antarctica.

1. Desired Orbital Altitude: Let's assume you want the missile to enter a low Earth orbit at an altitude of 200 km (200,000 meters).

2. Orbital Velocity: Using the formula for orbital velocity, we calculate the speed the missile needs to achieve for the desired altitude:

   Orbital Velocity = √((Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth) / (Orbital Radius))
   Orbital Velocity = √((6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (200,000 m))
   Orbital Velocity ≈ 7,905 m/s

3. Launch and Reach: The missile's launch velocity will be around 7,905 m/s. Now, let's calculate the time it takes for the missile to reach the desired altitude using the kinematic equation:

   Time of Reach = (Final Velocity - Initial Velocity) / Acceleration

   Since the missile's speed at the peak of its trajectory is 0 m/s, and acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s²:
   
   Time of Reach = (0 - 7,905 m/s) / (-9.81 m/s²)
   Time of Reach ≈ 804 seconds or 13.4 minutes

In this example, the missile would need to reach a launch velocity of approximately 7,905 m/s to enter a low Earth orbit at an altitude of 200 km over Antarctica. It would take around 13.4 minutes for the missile to reach this altitude. Keep in mind that this example doesn't account for real-world factors such as air resistance, the Earth's rotation, and the precise trajectory required to hit a specific point in Antarctica. Actual launch scenarios involve complex calculations and considerations.

- Adjusting to 45secs:
To reach the target in 45 seconds, you would need to make significant adjustments to the missile's launch parameters, including the launch velocity and the desired orbital altitude. Keep in mind that achieving such a short time of reach would require extremely high speeds and significant challenges.

Let's work through a hypothetical scenario where the missile is launched from Brazil to reach the target in 45 seconds. We'll adjust the orbital altitude to make the calculations more feasible:

1. Desired Time of Reach: You want the missile to reach the target in 45 seconds.

2. Adjusted Orbital Altitude: Given the short time frame, you'll need to aim for a very low Earth orbit. Let's choose an altitude of 100 km (100,000 meters).

3. Orbital Velocity: Using the formula for orbital velocity, calculate the new speed required for the adjusted altitude:

   Orbital Velocity = √((Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth) / (Orbital Radius))
   Orbital Velocity = √((6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (100,000 m))
   Orbital Velocity ≈ 10,733 m/s

4. Launch and Reach: The missile's launch velocity would need to be around 10,733 m/s to reach the desired orbital altitude of 100 km within 45 seconds.

Please note that achieving such high launch velocities and short time frames is far beyond the capabilities of current technology. The tremendous energy requirements, technological challenges, and safety concerns associated with such rapid acceleration make this scenario purely hypothetical and speculative.

Additionally, launching missiles with such high speeds and short time frames poses significant risks and potential consequences. It's crucial to approach space-related activities responsibly and adhere to international regulations and ethical considerations.

- 21 Secs:
Reaching a target in just 21 seconds would require even more extreme adjustments to the missile's parameters. Achieving such high speeds in a short time frame is exceedingly challenging and far beyond current technological capabilities. However, let's proceed with a hypothetical example to demonstrate the calculations:

1. Desired Time of Reach: You want the missile to reach the target in 21 seconds.

2. Adjusted Orbital Altitude: Given the extremely short time frame, let's choose an even lower orbital altitude of 50 km (50,000 meters).

3. Orbital Velocity: Using the formula for orbital velocity, calculate the new speed required for the adjusted altitude:

   Orbital Velocity = √((Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth) / (Orbital Radius))
   Orbital Velocity = √((6.67430 × 10^-11 m³/kg/s² * 5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (50,000 m))
   Orbital Velocity ≈ 15,105 m/s

4. Launch and Reach: The missile's launch velocity would need to be around 15,105 m/s to reach the desired orbital altitude of 50 km within 21 seconds.

It's essential to emphasize that achieving such velocities and short time frames is currently beyond our technological capabilities due to the immense energy requirements, engineering challenges, and potential risks involved. This scenario remains highly speculative and is provided purely for illustrative purposes. Responsible and safe space exploration is of paramount importance, and any real-world endeavors should be undertaken with careful consideration of ethical, legal, and technical factors.
