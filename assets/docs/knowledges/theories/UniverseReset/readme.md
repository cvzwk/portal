-----------------------------     

Anti Quarks can convert all matter of universe to one null singularity similar one reset in the natter state.
Is similar one effect of empty all matter of universe.

this is maded from one event self chain reaction that possible revert all quarks (normal matter)   
to anti quarks, null state of matter  

- Events:

Mass-Energy Equivalence: when the mass of matter can be converted into energy       
Antimatter annihilation: When matter and antimatter collide, they annihilate each other, releasing a large amount of energy. This is the most efficient way to convert matter into energy
