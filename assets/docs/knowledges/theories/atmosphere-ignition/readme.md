# The ignition of the atmosphere theory

is a hypothetical scenario in which a nuclear bomb could ignite the atmosphere, causing a runaway chain reaction that would destroy the planet. The theory was first proposed in 1942 by Edward Teller, who reasoned that a nuclear explosion could heat the atmosphere to a point where the nitrogen atoms would fuse together, releasing a massive amount of energy. This energy would then cause more nitrogen atoms to fuse, creating a self-sustaining chain reaction.

However, subsequent calculations have shown that the ignition of the atmosphere is not possible. The energy released by a nuclear explosion is simply not enough to heat the atmosphere to the necessary temperatures. Additionally, the atmosphere is constantly being bombarded by cosmic rays, which would also prevent the formation of a runaway chain reaction.

As a result, the ignition of the atmosphere theory is now considered to be a fringe theory with no scientific basis. However, it remains a popular topic of discussion among physicists and science fiction writers.

Here are some of the reasons why the ignition of the atmosphere is not possible:

* The energy released by a nuclear explosion is not enough to heat the atmosphere to the necessary temperatures.
* The atmosphere is constantly being bombarded by cosmic rays, which would also prevent the formation of a runaway chain reaction.
* The nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere are not easily fused together.
* The atmosphere is too large and dispersed for a chain reaction to propagate.

In conclusion, the ignition of the atmosphere is a hypothetical scenario that is not supported by scientific evidence. While it is possible that a nuclear explosion could cause the atmosphere to heat up significantly, it is not possible for this to lead to a runaway chain reaction that would destroy the planet.

# Hypothetical form of the ignition of the atmosphere theory:

* Suppose that a nuclear bomb could be detonated in the atmosphere with enough power to heat the atmosphere to a point where the nitrogen atoms would fuse together.
* Suppose that this fusion reaction would release a massive amount of energy, which would then cause more nitrogen atoms to fuse, creating a self-sustaining chain reaction.
* In this hypothetical scenario, the ignition of the atmosphere would lead to a runaway chain reaction that would destroy the planet.

However, as I mentioned earlier, there is no scientific evidence to support this hypothesis. The energy released by a nuclear explosion is simply not enough to heat the atmosphere to the necessary temperatures. Additionally, the atmosphere is constantly being bombarded by cosmic rays, which would also prevent the formation of a runaway chain reaction.

Therefore, while the ignition of the atmosphere is a hypothetical scenario that is not supported by scientific evidence, it remains a popular topic of discussion among physicists and science fiction writers.

- Paths to the assumptions:
Details about each of the three assumptions:

* **Assumption 1:** The energy released by a nuclear bomb is sufficient to heat the atmosphere to the point where nitrogen atoms fuse.

The power of a nuclear bomb is measured in megatons, where one megaton equals one million tons of TNT. The most powerful bomb ever detonated was Bomba Tsar, which had a power of 50 megatons. Such a bomb would have released enough energy to heat the atmosphere to around 10,000 degrees Celsius.

However, the temperature required to fuse nitrogen atoms is around 100 million degrees Celsius. Therefore, even the most powerful bomb ever detonated would not be enough to heat the atmosphere to the point where nitrogen atoms fuse together.

* **Assumption 2:** The fusing of nitrogen atoms would release an enormous amount of energy, which would then cause more nitrogen atoms to fuse together, creating a self-sustaining chain reaction.

Nuclear fusion is a process where two atomic nuclei are combined to form a heavier atomic nucleus. This process releases an enormous amount of energy. Hydrogen fusion is the process that powers stars, and it is also the process that is used in nuclear fusion reactors.

Nitrogen fusion is a much more difficult process than hydrogen fusion. This is because nitrogen atoms are much heavier and have a higher electrical charge than hydrogen atoms. This makes it harder for the nitrogen atoms to get close enough to fuse.

Furthermore, the fusion of nitrogen requires much higher temperatures than the fusion of hydrogen. This is because the repulsive force between protons in nitrogen atoms is much greater than the attractive force between protons in hydrogen atoms.

Therefore, even if the nuclear bomb were able to heat the atmosphere to the point where nitrogen atoms fuse, it would not be enough to create a self-sustaining chain reaction.

* **Assumption 3:** The atmosphere is too large and dispersed for a chain reaction to propagate.

The Earth's atmosphere is made up of a layer of air that surrounds the planet. The atmosphere is very large and dispersed. The thickness of the atmosphere varies from about 10 kilometers at sea level to about 100 kilometers at the edge of the atmosphere.

A chain reaction is a reaction that propagates from one atom to another. For a chain reaction to occur, the atoms must be close enough to interact. The atmosphere is too large and dispersed for the nitrogen atoms to be close enough together to interact.

So even if the nuclear bomb were able to heat the atmosphere to the point where nitrogen atoms fuse together, it wouldn't be enough to create a chain reaction.

In conclusion, the hypothesis that the atmosphere can be ignited by a nuclear bomb is not supported by scientific evidence. While it is possible for a nuclear bomb to cause the atmosphere to heat up significantly, it is not possible for this to lead to a chain reaction that destroys the planet.

# Alternatives to the ignition of the atmosphere theory:

* **Thermal runaway**. This is a scenario in which a nuclear explosion could cause the atmosphere to heat up to the point where it would start to trap its own heat. This would lead to a positive feedback loop, in which the atmosphere would continue to heat up until it reached a critical point and ignited.
* **Nuclear winter**. This is a scenario in which a nuclear war would cause so much smoke and dust to be released into the atmosphere that it would block out the sun. This would lead to a global cooling event, which could potentially cause the extinction of many species.
* **EMP**. This is a scenario in which a nuclear explosion would generate a powerful electromagnetic pulse that would disrupt electrical systems around the world. This could lead to widespread chaos and disruption, and could potentially even cause a global blackout.

These are just a few of the alternative scenarios that have been proposed as a result of the ignition of the atmosphere theory. While none of these scenarios are as destructive as the ignition of the atmosphere, they still represent significant threats to human civilization.

Here is some more detail about each of these alternatives:

* **Thermal runaway**. Thermal runaway is a phenomenon that can occur in any system that is heated up. In the case of the atmosphere, thermal runaway would occur if a nuclear explosion caused the atmosphere to heat up to a point where it would start to trap its own heat. This would lead to a positive feedback loop, in which the atmosphere would continue to heat up until it reached a critical point and ignited.

Thermal runaway is a very difficult phenomenon to predict, as it depends on a variety of factors, including the amount of energy released by the nuclear explosion, the composition of the atmosphere, and the presence of any other factors that could contribute to the heating of the atmosphere. However, it is generally believed that thermal runaway is not a very likely scenario, as it would require a very large and powerful nuclear explosion.

* **Nuclear winter**. Nuclear winter is a scenario in which a nuclear war would cause so much smoke and dust to be released into the atmosphere that it would block out the sun. This would lead to a global cooling event, which could potentially cause the extinction of many species.

Nuclear winter is a more likely scenario than thermal runaway, as it could be caused by a much smaller nuclear war. However, it is still a very difficult phenomenon to predict, as it depends on a variety of factors, including the size of the nuclear war, the location of the nuclear explosions, and the weather patterns at the time of the war.

* **EMP**. EMP is a scenario in which a nuclear explosion would generate a powerful electromagnetic pulse that would disrupt electrical systems around the world. This could lead to widespread chaos and disruption, and could potentially even cause a global blackout.

EMP is a very real threat, as it has been demonstrated that nuclear explosions can generate EMPs. However, it is not clear how likely it is that an EMP would cause a global blackout. This would depend on a variety of factors, including the location of the nuclear explosion, the altitude of the explosion, and the state of the electrical grid at the time of the explosion.

In conclusion, the ignition of the atmosphere theory is a hypothetical scenario that is not supported by scientific evidence. However, there are a number of alternative scenarios that have been proposed, each of which poses a significant threat to human civilization. It is important to be aware of these threats and to take steps to mitigate them.

# Fusion of hydrogen present on atmosphere   

It is not possible to fuse all atoms of hydrogen in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases. Hydrogen only makes up about 0.00005% of the atmosphere. Even if we could somehow fuse all of the hydrogen in the atmosphere, it would only produce a tiny amount of energy.

The amount of energy required to fuse all of the hydrogen in the atmosphere is about 10^44 joules. This is about 100,000 times more energy than the Sun produces in a year. It is simply not possible to produce this much energy with current technology.

Even if we could produce this much energy, it would not be possible to fuse all of the hydrogen in the atmosphere at once. The hydrogen atoms in the atmosphere are too spread out. In order to fuse them, we would need to heat them up to a very high temperature, about 100 million degrees Celsius. This is much hotter than the core of the Sun.

Even if we could overcome these challenges, it would not be a good idea to fuse all of the hydrogen in the atmosphere. The resulting explosion would be so powerful that it would destroy the Earth.

So, to answer your question, it would require an infinite amount of each element to reach in the fusion of all atoms of hydrogen of the atmosphere.
