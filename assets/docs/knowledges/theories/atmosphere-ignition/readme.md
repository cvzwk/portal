# The ignition of the atmosphere theory

is a hypothetical scenario in which a nuclear bomb could ignite the atmosphere, causing a runaway chain reaction that would destroy the planet. The theory was first proposed in 1942 by Edward Teller, who reasoned that a nuclear explosion could heat the atmosphere to a point where the nitrogen atoms would fuse together, releasing a massive amount of energy. This energy would then cause more nitrogen atoms to fuse, creating a self-sustaining chain reaction.

However, subsequent calculations have shown that the ignition of the atmosphere is not possible. The energy released by a nuclear explosion is simply not enough to heat the atmosphere to the necessary temperatures. Additionally, the atmosphere is constantly being bombarded by cosmic rays, which would also prevent the formation of a runaway chain reaction.

As a result, the ignition of the atmosphere theory is now considered to be a fringe theory with no scientific basis. However, it remains a popular topic of discussion among physicists and science fiction writers.

Here are some of the reasons why the ignition of the atmosphere is not possible:

* The energy released by a nuclear explosion is not enough to heat the atmosphere to the necessary temperatures.
* The atmosphere is constantly being bombarded by cosmic rays, which would also prevent the formation of a runaway chain reaction.
* The nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere are not easily fused together.
* The atmosphere is too large and dispersed for a chain reaction to propagate.

In conclusion, the ignition of the atmosphere is a hypothetical scenario that is not supported by scientific evidence. While it is possible that a nuclear explosion could cause the atmosphere to heat up significantly, it is not possible for this to lead to a runaway chain reaction that would destroy the planet.
