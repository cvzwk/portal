- Paper that Describe the Generation proposal of Repulsive Force-Field:

A method is proposed in this paper to generate a repulsive gravitational force field, which can strongly repel material particles and photons of any frequency. By repelling particles and photons, including in the infrared range, this force field can work as a perfect thermal insulation. It can also work as a friction reducer with the atmosphere, for example, between an aeronave and the atmosphere. A spacecraft with this force field around it cannot be affected by any external temperature and, in this way, it can even penetrate (and to exit) the Sun, for example, without be damaged or to cause the death of the crew. The generation of this force field is based on the reversion and intensification of gravity by electromagnetic means

# Repulsive Force-Field  

While the specific methods for generating a repulsive force field as described in the paper are not mentioned, I can provide some general approaches that could potentially be used to generate such a force field:

1. Electromagnetic Resonance: As mentioned in the paper, one approach could involve the use of an electromagnetic resonant cavity. This involves creating a strong electromagnetic field within a specific resonant cavity and oscillating it at the resonant frequency. The interaction between the electromagnetic field and the cavity could lead to the generation of a repulsive force field.

2. Electromagnetic Fields: Another approach involves the use of powerful electromagnetic fields. By utilizing strong magnetic fields and rapidly changing electric fields, it might be possible to manipulate the space-time curvature and create a repulsive force field. The precise configuration and parameters of the electromagnetic fields would need to be carefully controlled and optimized.

3. Gravitoelectromagnetism: Gravitoelectromagnetism is a theory that describes the behavior of gravitational and electromagnetic fields in certain scenarios. By manipulating gravitational and electromagnetic fields in a coordinated manner, it might be possible to generate a repulsive force field. This could involve exploiting the interaction between these fields and taking advantage of any possible coupling effects.

4. Exotic Material Properties: Another potential method could involve the use of materials with exotic properties that interact with electromagnetic fields in a way that generates a repulsive force. This could require the development of new materials or the utilization of known materials in unique configurations.

It is important to note that the specific details and feasibility of these methods would require extensive research and experimentation. The paper you mentioned might provide more specific insights into the proposed method for generating a repulsive force field and the experimental evidence supporting it.
