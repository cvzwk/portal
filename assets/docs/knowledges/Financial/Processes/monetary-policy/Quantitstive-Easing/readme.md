Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy action where a central bank purchases predetermined amounts of government bonds or other financial assets in order to stimulate economic activity. Quantitative easing is a novel form of monetary policy that came into wide application after the financial crisis of 2007–2008. It is used to mitigate an economic recession when inflation is very low or negative, making standard monetary policy ineffective.

Here is how QE works:

1. The central bank buys government bonds or other financial assets from banks and other financial institutions.
2. This increases the amount of money in the economy.
3. The increased money supply makes it easier for banks to lend money to businesses and consumers.
4. This stimulates economic activity and helps to create jobs.

QE is a controversial policy, with some economists arguing that it is effective in stimulating the economy and others arguing that it is not. The effectiveness of QE depends on a number of factors, including the state of the economy, the amount of money that is injected into the economy, and the way in which the money is used.

The following are some of the potential benefits of QE:

* It can help to stimulate economic activity and create jobs.
* It can help to lower interest rates.
* It can help to improve the functioning of the financial system.

The following are some of the potential risks of QE:

* It can lead to inflation.
* It can lead to asset bubbles.
* It can make it more difficult for the central bank to control interest rates in the future.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to use QE is a difficult one that must be made on a case-by-case basis. There is no guarantee that QE will be successful, but it can be a useful tool in the arsenal of a central bank.

Here are some examples of countries that have used QE:

* The United States: The Federal Reserve used QE extensively during the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the subsequent recession.
* The United Kingdom: The Bank of England used QE on a smaller scale than the Federal Reserve, but it also used it to help stimulate the economy.
* Japan: The Bank of Japan has used QE for many years in an attempt to stimulate its economy.
* China: The People's Bank of China has also used QE to try to stimulate its economy.

QE is a complex policy with both potential benefits and risks. It is important to weigh these carefully before deciding whether or not to use it.
