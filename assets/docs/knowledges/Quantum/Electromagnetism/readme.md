Michael Faraday developed a number of equations that are still used today to study and understand electromagnetism. These equations can be divided into two categories:

* **Electromagnetic induction:** These equations describe how a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current in a nearby circuit. The most famous equation in this category is Faraday's law of induction, which states that the magnitude of the induced electromotive force (emf) is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit.
* **Magnetostatics:** These equations describe the properties of static magnetic fields. The most famous equation in this category is Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the total magnetic flux through a closed surface is equal to zero.

Here is a table summarizing the most important Faraday equations per topics categories:

| Category | Equation | Description |
