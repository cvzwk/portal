# The Runge-Kutta method
   is a largely used numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations,   
    such as the relevant equations for the integration of tov equation.   
     Specifically, the fourth order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) is one of the most common methods of this class.    

   RK4 involves evaluating various functions derived at intermediate points to obtain a solution approach in a particular integration step.    
    Next, I describe the basic procedure of RK4:    
    
   1. Given a starting point (R0, P0, M0), where R0 is the initial radius,    
       P0 is the initial pressure and m0 is the initial accumulated mass.   

   2. Choose a step of integration h.    
   
   3. Calculate the following intermediate quantities for the current point (RN, PN, MN):
 
   a)   
   
    k1 = h * f (rn, pn, mn), where f is the function that represents the tov equation   
      
   b)    
    
    k2 = h * f (rn + h/2, pn + k1/2, mn + k1/2)    
   
   c)     
      
    k3 = h * f (rn + h/2, pn + k2/2, mn + k2/2)      
    
   d)    
     
    k4 = h * f (rn + h, pn + k3, mn + k3)       
     
4. Update the quantities for the next point (RN+1, PN+1, MN+1):    

    a)   
      
       RN + 1 = rn + h    
   
    b)    
      
       Pn + 1 = Pn + (K1 + 2k2 + 2k3 + k4) / 6    
   
    c)    
     
       mn + 1 = mn + 4πr³n (pn + k3)    
    
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you reach the desired end point.     
    This process is repeated for each integration step,    
     updating the quantities of pressure (P) and accumulated mass (m) at each point.     
      The end result will be a pressure distribution as a function of the radius,       
       which describes the internal structure of the object in hydrostatic equilibrium.   

It is noteworthy that RK4 is just an example of Runge-Kutta method and there are variations with different precision and complexity orders.    
 In addition, the implementation of RK4 to resolve the TOV equation requires advanced programming knowledge and numerical calculation.
