# [Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff](./Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff.md):  
  - is a set of equations used to describe the structure and stability of a spherically symmetric, non-rotating,   
     and static object under the influence of gravity.   
      It provides the theoretical framework for understanding   
       the maximum mass a compact object like a neutron star can have before it collapses into a black hole.
