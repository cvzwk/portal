In the fusion of substances,    
 as in the case of the elements uranium and mercury,     
  the temperature remains constant during the process.   
   During fusion, the energy provided is used to overcome intermolecular forces and convert the substance from the solid state to the liquid state.    
    During this process, the temperature remains constant until all of the substance has converted to liquid.    
 
This occurs because the energy supplied is used to break intermolecular bonds and overcome the attraction between molecules,    
 instead of raising the temperature of the substance.    
  This constant temperature during melting is known as the melting point.   
  
Therefore, during the melting of uranium or mercury,    
 the temperature will remain constant until all the material has been converted to a liquid state.    
  Only after complete melting will the temperature begin to rise again if additional energy is supplied to the system.  

 When liquid mercury at a negative temperature comes into contact with uranium at a high temperature,      
  heat transfer will occur between the two materials. During this interaction,      
   the temperature of mercury tends to increase, while the temperature of uranium tends to decrease.      
        
This is because liquid mercury, initially at a negative temperature,      
 will absorb heat from uranium at an elevated temperature due to the temperature difference between the two materials.        
  Thermal energy will be transferred from the uranium to the mercury,      
   increasing the temperature of the mercury and decreasing the temperature of the uranium.      
   
It is important to emphasize that the heat transfer between the materials will depend on several factors,    
 such as the thermal properties of the materials, the relative amount of mercury and uranium, the contact area, among others. Furthermore,    
  uranium is a material with a high capacity to store heat due to its high density and thermal conductivity,    
   while mercury, being a liquid,    
    has a relatively lower heat storage capacity.    
     Therefore, the temperature of mercury will tend to increase more rapidly compared to the decrease in temperature of uranium.
