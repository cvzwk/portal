The oldest known galaxy in the observable Universe is GN-z11, which was discovered in 2016 using data from the Hubble Space Telescope. GN-z11 is located in the constellation Ursa Major and is estimated to be around 13.4 billion years old. This means that it is one of the earliest known galaxies, having formed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.

GN-z11 is a type of galaxy known as a "redshift 7 galaxy," meaning that it has a redshift value of 7. This indicates that it is moving away from us very quickly and is located at a very large distance from Earth. The redshift value also tells us that GN-z11 formed when the Universe was just 3% of its current age.

The discovery of GN-z11 and other early galaxies has allowed astronomers to study the Universe in its infancy and gain a better understanding of its formation and evolution. By observing these early galaxies, scientists hope to learn more about the formation of stars and galaxies, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the overall structure of the Universe.

In addition to its age, GN-z11 is also notable for its small size and massive star-forming activity. It is estimated to have a mass that is less than one percent of our Milky Way galaxy, but is producing new stars at a rate that is around twenty-five times higher than the Milky Way. These extreme conditions are thought to be necessary for the early Universe to produce the massive galaxies we see today.

The discovery of GN-z11 was made possible by the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Wide Field Camera. These instruments were able to detect the galaxy's faint light, which had traveled across the Universe for billions of years to reach Earth. By analyzing the light from GN-z11, astronomers were able to determine its age, size, and rate of star formation.

Overall, the discovery of GN-z11 has provided new insights into the early Universe and its formation. As telescopes and technology continue to improve, it is likely that we will discover even more ancient galaxies and uncover more secrets of the Universe's past.

In terms of specific numerical values, GN-z11 is estimated to have a redshift value of 11.1, which translates to a distance of around 32 billion light-years from Earth, due to the expansion of the Universe. Its age is estimated to be around 400 million years after the Big Bang, which corresponds to a time called the reionization epoch during which the Universe transitioned from a neutral to an ionized state. GN-z11 is also estimated to have a mass of around one billion times the mass of our Sun and is producing stars at a rate of around 20 solar masses per year. This is an extremely high rate of star formation and is thought to be necessary for the early Universe to produce the massive galaxies that we see today.

In terms of the reionization of GN-z11, this process is thought to have been triggered by the formation of the first stars in the galaxy. These stars, which were likely much larger and more massive than typical modern stars, emitted intense ultraviolet radiation, which ionized the hydrogen gas in the surrounding intergalactic medium. This allowed the light from the stars to travel more freely through the Universe, and also potentially triggered the formation of other galaxies and stars.

The properties of GN-z11, including its age, mass, and star formation rate, suggest that it may have played an important role in the reionization of the early Universe. Observing galaxies like GN-z11 can therefore provide valuable insights into the processes that drove the Universe's transition from a neutral to an ionized state.
