# J1135   

Galaxy J1135 is a distant galaxy that was first observed in 2007. It is located 12 billion light-years away from Earth and formed when the universe was only 1.8 billion years old. J1135 is a starburst galaxy, which means that it is forming stars at a rapid rate.

J1135 is notable for its large reservoir of water vapor. In 2023, an international team of astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to create the first water map of a galaxy beyond the Milky Way. The water map showed that J1135 has a large amount of water vapor concentrated in its central region. This suggests that J1135 is a very active starburst galaxy.

The water in J1135 is thought to be produced by the shock waves that are generated when new stars form. The shock waves heat up the gas and dust in the galaxy, causing it to condense and form water molecules. The water molecules then emit radiation in the form of water vapor.

The water map of J1135 is a significant step forward in our understanding of how water is distributed in galaxies. It shows that water is present in galaxies even at very early times, and that it plays a role in the formation of stars. The water map also provides new insights into the physical processes that are taking place in starburst galaxies.
