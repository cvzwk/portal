# Quasar   

A quasar is an extremely bright active galactic nucleus (AGN) that emits enormous amounts of energy from a very compact region. Quasars are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies.

Quasars are so bright that they can outshine entire galaxies. They are also very distant, with the closest known quasar being about 700 million light-years away.

Quasars were first discovered in 1963 by astronomer Allan Sandage. He was studying the spectrum of a star in the constellation Ursa Major when he noticed that it had an unusual emission line. This emission line was later identified as hydrogen, but it was much more redshifted than any other hydrogen emission line that had been seen before.

This redshift meant that the star was moving away from Earth at an enormous speed. Sandage realized that he was not looking at a star, but at a quasar, which is a much more distant object.

Quasars are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. These black holes are millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun.

Gas and dust fall into the black hole, and as it does, it heats up and emits radiation. This radiation is what we see as the quasar's light.

Quasars are thought to be very young objects. They are only visible for a few million years before they fade away.

Quasars are important objects for astronomers because they can tell us about the early universe. They are also important for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies.

* **Some Properties Of Quasar's*

Here are some of the properties of quasars:

* **Brightness:** Quasars are the most luminous objects in the universe. They can outshine entire galaxies.
* **Distance:** Quasars are very distant, with the closest known quasar being about 700 million light-years away.
* **Redshift:** Quasars have a very high redshift, which means that they are moving away from Earth at an enormous speed.
* **Spectrum:** The spectrum of a quasar shows emission lines from elements that are only found in very hot gas. This gas is thought to be the material that is falling into the supermassive black hole that powers the quasar.
* **Jets:** Quasars often have jets of material that are ejected at high speeds. These jets can be millions of light-years long.

Quasars are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. These black holes are millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun.

Gas and dust fall into the black hole, and as it does, it heats up and emits radiation. This radiation is what we see as the quasar's light.

The jets of material that are ejected from quasars are thought to be caused by the magnetic field of the black hole. The magnetic field accelerates the material to very high speeds, and it is this material that forms the jets.

Quasars are important objects for astronomers because they can tell us about the early universe. They are also important for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies.

Here are some of the implications of quasar properties:

* **The brightness of quasars tells us how much energy they are emitting.** This energy is thought to be coming from the supermassive black hole at the center of the quasar.

* **Quasar Surveys:** Astronomers conduct large-scale surveys to discover and catalog quasars across the universe. These surveys help in understanding the distribution, evolution, and statistical properties of quasars.

* **Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation:** Quasars can serve as probes of the early universe. By studying how quasar light interacts with the cosmic microwave background radiation, astronomers can learn about the conditions in the early universe shortly after the Big Bang.

* **Alternative Explanations:** While the prevailing model explains quasars as powered by supermassive black holes, alternative theories propose different mechanisms, such as the collapse of exotic objects called "quark stars."

* **Quasar Lifecycles:** Quasars are thought to represent a phase in the evolution of certain galaxies. As the central black hole accretes mass and emits radiation, it can influence the surrounding environment and potentially trigger star formation, shaping the galaxy's overall evolution.

* **Black Hole Mass Measurement:** Quasars provide a unique opportunity to measure the masses of supermassive black holes. By studying the motion of gas and stars around the central black hole, astronomers can estimate its mass and understand the relationship between black hole mass and galaxy properties.

# Quasar Formation   

Quasars are thought to be formed when a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy begins to accrete large amounts of gas and dust. This gas and dust falls into the black hole at extremely high speeds, and as it does, it heats up and emits radiation. This radiation is what we see as the quasar's light.

Quasars are thought to be very young objects. They are only visible for a few million years before they fade away. This is because the black hole eventually runs out of gas and dust to accrete.

Quasars are thought to be most common in the early universe. This is because there was more gas and dust available in the early universe, and the galaxies were also more compact. This made it easier for supermassive black holes to form and accrete large amounts of gas and dust.

As the universe expanded, the galaxies became more spread out, and there was less gas and dust available. This made it more difficult for supermassive black holes to form and accrete large amounts of gas and dust. As a result, quasars are much less common today.

Quasars are important objects for astronomers because they can tell us about the early universe. They are also important for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies.

Here are some of the theories about quasar formation:

* **The merger of galaxies:** One theory is that quasars are formed when two galaxies merge. This can cause a large amount of gas and dust to be drawn into the center of the new galaxy, where it can fall into the supermassive black hole and power a quasar.
* **The collapse of a massive cloud of gas:** Another theory is that quasars are formed when a massive cloud of gas collapses in on itself. This can cause the cloud to heat up and emit radiation, which can power a quasar.
* **The accretion of a small galaxy:** It is also possible that quasars are formed when a small galaxy is accreted by a larger galaxy. This can cause the small galaxy to be torn apart, and the gas and dust from the small galaxy can fall into the supermassive black hole in the larger galaxy and power a quasar.

Quasar formation is still a mystery, and astronomers are still learning about how quasars form. However, the theories described above are some of the most likely explanations for how quasars come to be.   

* **Eddington Limit:** One of the key factors in quasar formation is the Eddington limit. This is the maximum rate at which a black hole can accrete mass before the radiation pressure from the emitted energy balances the gravitational attraction. Quasars are believed to operate near or even exceed this limit, causing them to emit such intense radiation.

* **Role of Magnetic Fields:** The presence and behavior of magnetic fields play a crucial role in the accretion process around supermassive black holes. Magnetic fields can help channel and direct the infalling gas and dust onto the black hole, influencing the accretion rate and the formation of accretion disks.

* **Feedback Mechanisms:** While quasars are powered by the accretion of material onto supermassive black holes, they can also have a feedback effect on their surroundings. The immense energy and radiation released by quasars can influence the gas and dust in their host galaxies, affecting star formation, galactic dynamics, and even the growth of the central black hole itself.

* **Quenching Star Formation:** The intense radiation from quasars can heat and ionize the gas in their host galaxies. This process can suppress the formation of new stars in the galaxy by preventing the gas from cooling and collapsing to form stars. This feedback effect can impact the long-term evolution of both the quasar and its host galaxy.

* **Observational Challenges:** Studying quasar formation is challenging due to their short-lived nature and the difficulty of observing galaxies undergoing mergers or other processes that trigger quasar activity. Advanced telescopes and observational techniques are required to catch glimpses of these transient events and gather insights into the formation process.

Quasar formation remains an active area of research, and as astronomers continue to study these powerful objects, they are likely to uncover more details about the complex interplay of factors that lead to their creation.

* **Quasar Triggering Mechanisms:** Besides the merger of galaxies and the collapse of gas clouds, other mechanisms can trigger quasar activity. For instance, interactions between galaxies or interactions with smaller objects like stars or black holes can disrupt the normal flow of material toward the supermassive black hole, leading to temporary increases in accretion and quasar-like behavior.

* **Duty Cycle:** Quasars are not continuously active throughout their existence. Their "duty cycle" refers to the fraction of time they spend in an active quasar phase compared to their total lifespan. Understanding the duty cycle can provide insights into the frequency and duration of quasar activity episodes.

* **Dual AGN:** In some cases, galaxies contain not one, but two supermassive black holes at their centers. When these black holes approach each other due to galaxy mergers, they can eventually merge as well. The process leading to the merger of the black holes can result in intense quasar-like emissions, known as dual AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) systems.

* **Cosmic Web and Filaments:** The large-scale structure of the universe, known as the cosmic web, consists of interconnected filaments of galaxies and dark matter. It's theorized that gas and dust can flow along these filaments, providing a steady supply of material for black hole accretion and quasar activity.

* **Role of Dark Matter:** Dark matter, which does not emit light, plays a significant role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central black holes. The distribution of dark matter affects the dynamics of galaxies and can influence the conditions for quasar activity.

* **Studying the Transition Phase:** Catching galaxies in the transitional phase from non-quasar to quasar activity is challenging but crucial. Observations of objects with intermediate characteristics can provide valuable insights into the factors that trigger the onset of quasar behavior.

* **Simulations and Modeling:** Computer simulations and theoretical models play a vital role in understanding quasar formation. These simulations help researchers test different scenarios, understand the complex physical processes, and make predictions that can be compared to observations.

In the coming years, advancements in observational technology, computational capabilities, and theoretical understanding are likely to contribute to a deeper understanding of quasar formation and the intricate interplay of factors that lead to the birth of these remarkable cosmic phenomena.

* **AGN Unification:** Quasars are a type of active galactic nucleus (AGN). The unified model of AGN proposes that the observed differences between various AGN types, such as quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and blazars, can be attributed to differences in viewing angle and orientation.

* **Accretion Disk:** The accretion of gas onto the supermassive black hole forms an accretion disk—a swirling, flattened structure of hot, glowing material. This disk is a key component in the quasar's energy production, as friction and compression within the disk release vast amounts of energy in the form of radiation.

* **Broad Line Region and Narrow Line Region:** In quasar spectra, emission lines are divided into two regions: the broad line region (BLR) and the narrow line region (NLR). The BLR contains lines that are broader due to the motion of gas around the black hole, while the NLR lines are narrower and originate from further out in the quasar's surroundings.

* **Quasar "Fossil" Evidence:** Some galaxies that no longer exhibit quasar activity might still show signs of past quasar episodes. Astronomers look for signatures like remnants of quasar-driven outflows, which can leave behind telltale marks on the galaxy's structure and composition.

* **Outflows and Winds:** Quasars often exhibit powerful outflows of gas and material that are accelerated away from the central black hole. These outflows can have a profound impact on the galaxy's interstellar medium, redistributing energy, gas, and elements, and potentially affecting star formation.

* **Baldwin Effect:** The Baldwin effect is an empirical correlation between the equivalent width of certain emission lines and the luminosity of AGNs, including quasars. It suggests that more luminous quasars have relatively weaker emission lines, which can provide insights into the structure and physical conditions of the emitting gas.

* **Feedback and Quasar Evolution:** The feedback effects of quasars, especially their ability to heat and expel gas from galaxies, can influence the growth and evolution of both the black hole and the host galaxy. This feedback can be crucial in understanding why quasars are less common in the present-day universe.

* **Future Exploration:** Upcoming observatories and instruments, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), are expected to provide more detailed insights into the processes driving quasar formation and evolution.

# Equations About Quasar's   

1. **Eddington Luminosity Limit:** The Eddington luminosity, which describes the maximum luminosity a black hole can achieve without blowing away its accretion material due to radiation pressure, is given by:

   Where $\( M \)$ is the mass of the black hole and $\( M_{\odot} \)$ is the solar mass.

2. **Black Hole Schwarzschild Radius:** The Schwarzschild radius, which defines the size of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole, is given by:

   $\[ R_{\text{Sch}} = \frac{2GM}{c^2} \]$

   Where $\( G \)$ is the gravitational constant, $\( M \)$ is the mass of the black hole, and $\( c \)$ is the speed of light.

3. **Accretion Disk Temperature:** The temperature of an accretion disk around a black hole can be estimated using the blackbody temperature formula:

   $\[ T = \left( \frac{3GM\dot{M}}{8\pi\sigma R^3} \right)^{1/4} \]$

   Where $\( G \)$ is the gravitational constant, $\( M \)$ is the mass of the black hole, $\( \dot{M} \)$ is the mass accretion rate, $\( \sigma \)$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $\( R \)$ is the radial distance from the black hole.

4. **Luminosity-Accretion Rate Relationship:** The luminosity of a quasar is often related to the accretion rate onto the central black hole:

   $\[ L = \eta \cdot \dot{M} c^2 \]$

   Where $\( L \)$ is the luminosity, $\( \eta \)$ is the radiative efficiency (typically around 0.1 for accretion onto a black hole), $\( \dot{M} \)$ is the mass accretion rate, and $\( c \)$ is the speed of light.

5. **Quasar Redshift-Distance Relationship:** The redshift of a quasar is related to its distance through Hubble's law:

   $\[ z = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_{\text{obs}}} = \frac{v}{c} = H_0 \cdot D \]$

   Where $\( z \)$ is the redshift, $\( \Delta \lambda \)$ is the shift in wavelength, $\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)$ is the observed wavelength, $\( v \)$ is the recessional velocity of the quasar, $\( c \)$ is the speed of light, $\( H_0 \)$ is the Hubble constant, and $\( D \)$ is the distance to the quasar.

These equations provide insights into the fundamental relationships and physical properties underlying quasar behavior and characteristics.

1. **Black Hole Accretion Rate:** The mass accretion rate $(\( \dot{M} \))$ onto a black hole in terms of the luminosity $(\( L \))$ and radiative efficiency $(\( \eta \))$ can be expressed as:

   $\[ \dot{M} = \frac{L}{\eta c^2} \]$

   This equation relates the rate at which material is falling onto the black hole with the energy output in the form of radiation.

2. **Luminosity Distance and Flux:** The luminosity distance $(\( D_L \))$ of a quasar, which accounts for the dilution of its radiation over distance, can be calculated from the observed flux $(\( F \))$ and luminosity $(\( L \))$ using the inverse square law:

   $\[ D_L = \sqrt{\frac{L}{4\pi F}} \]$

   This equation allows us to determine how the observed brightness of a quasar changes with distance.

3. **Emission Line Width and Black Hole Mass:** The width of certain emission lines in a quasar's spectrum, such as the H-beta line, can be used to estimate the mass of the central black hole $(\( M_{\text{BH}} \))$ using the empirical virial theorem formula:

4. **Quasar Luminosity Function:** The quasar luminosity function $(\( \Phi \))$ describes the distribution of quasar luminosities. It can be represented as a power-law function:

   $\[ \Phi(L) = \Phi_* \left( \frac{L}{L_*} \right)^{-\alpha} \]$

   Where $\( \Phi_* \)$ is the normalization, $\( L_* \)$ is the characteristic luminosity, and $\( \alpha \)$ is the slope of the power-law.

5. **Radio-Loudness Parameter:** The radio-loudness parameter $(\( R \))$ for quasars, which quantifies the strength of their radio emission relative to their optical emission, can be calculated using flux densities:

   $\[ R = \frac{F_{\text{radio}}}{F_{\text{optical}}} \]$

   This parameter helps classify quasars into radio-loud and radio-quiet categories.

6. **Quasar Baldwin Effect:** The Baldwin effect is expressed as a power-law relationship between the equivalent width (\$( W_{\lambda} \))$ of an emission line and the continuum luminosity $(\( L_{\text{cont}} \))$:

   $\[ W_{\lambda} \propto L_{\text{cont}}^{-\beta} \]$

   This effect is observed in some quasars and helps to understand the behavior of emission lines with respect to luminosity.

These equations provide insights into various properties, relationships, and characteristics of quasars, allowing astronomers to model, analyze, and interpret their behaviors and physical processes.

1. **Black Hole Spin and Accretion Disk Properties:** The dimensionless spin parameter $(\(a\))$ of a rotating black hole is related to its angular momentum $(\(J\))$ and mass $(\(M\))$:

   $\[ a = \frac{cJ}{GM^2} \]$

   The spin of the black hole can influence the properties of the accretion disk and the jets it produces.

2. **Accretion Disk Thickness:** The vertical height $(\(H\))$ of an accretion disk can be related to its radial distance $(\(R\))$, speed of sound $(\(c_s\))$, and Keplerian angular velocity $(\(\Omega\))$:

   $\[ H = \frac{c_s}{\Omega} = \frac{R}{\mathcal{M}} \]$

   Where $\(\mathcal{M}\)$ is the Mach number characterizing the disk.

3. **Quasar Luminosity as Eddington Luminosity:** The ratio of a quasar's luminosity $(\(L\))$ to the Eddington luminosity $(\(L_{\text{Edd}}\))$ can be used to estimate its accretion rate:

   $\[ \frac{L}{L_{\text{Edd}}} = \frac{\dot{M}}{\dot{M}_{\text{Edd}}} \]$

   Where $\(\dot{M}\)$ is the mass accretion rate and $\(\dot{M}_{\text{Edd}}\)$ is the Eddington accretion rate.

4. **Quasar Variability Timescales:** The characteristic timescale $(\(\tau\))$ of quasar variability can be related to the size of the emitting region $(\(R\))$ and the speed of light $(\(c\))$:

   $\[ \tau = \frac{R}{c} \]$

   Short timescales indicate compact emitting regions close to the black hole.

5. **Schwarzschild Radius in Parsecs:** The Schwarzschild radius $(\(R_{\text{Sch}}\))$ of a black hole in parsecs can be obtained by converting the mass $(\(M\))$ to solar masses:

   $\[ R_{\text{Sch, pc}} = \frac{2GM}{c^2} \times \frac{1}{M_{\odot}} \times \frac{1}{3.086 \times 10^{16}} \]$

   This provides the size of the event horizon in parsecs.

6. **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Dipole Anisotropy:** The Doppler shift of the cosmic microwave background radiation due to Earth's motion is given by:

   $\[ \frac{\Delta T}{T} = \frac{v}{c} \]$

   Where $\(\Delta T\)$ is the temperature difference, $\(T\)$ is the temperature of the CMB, $\(v\)$ is Earth's velocity, and $\(c\)$ is the speed of light.

These equations provide mathematical representations of various relationships and physical phenomena associated with quasars and their environments.
