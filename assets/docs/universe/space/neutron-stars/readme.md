# Neutron stars  
  - are incredibly dense objects composed mainly of neutrons.    
      They are formed through the gravitational collapse of massive stars during a supernova explosion.    
       The process of creating a neutron star from solid rocks is not possible through natural astrophysical processes.  

    The collapse of a massive star's core occurs under extreme conditions of high temperature and pressure.    
     As the core collapses, the protons and electrons in the stellar material are squeezed together,    
      resulting in the conversion of protons into neutrons through a process called [Electron capture](/assets/docs/universe/space/knowledges/electron_capture.md)        This conversion releases electron neutrinos, which carry away some of the energy from the collapsing core.   
   
     During the collapse, the density of the core becomes so high that the atomic nuclei are crushed together,    
      and the electrons are forced to combine with protons to form neutrons.    
       This leads to the formation of a compact object composed primarily of neutrons,        
        with a small fraction of protons and electrons known as neutron star matter.   

      Therefore, the formation of a neutron star involves the collapse of a massive star's core and  
       the subsequent compression of atomic nuclei into a dense, neutron-rich material.    
        It is not possible to create a neutron star directly from solid rocks without undergoing the processes of   
         stellar evolution, core collapse, and supernova explosion.
