The concept of the Big Bang coordinates spatial refers to the framework used to describe the evolution of the universe since the Big Bang. This framework is based on the notion that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, meaning that it looks the same in all directions and at all locations. 

The coordinates used to describe the spatial aspects of the universe are usually Cartesian coordinates, with three dimensions of space. However, because the universe is expanding, distances between objects are changing over time, and this expansion must be accounted for in any coordinate system.

One commonly used coordinate system is the comoving coordinates, which adjust for the expansion of space. Comoving coordinates are based on a reference frame that is moving along with the expansion of the universe, so that distances between objects remain constant over time.

Another coordinate system used in cosmology is the cosmological redshift, which is based on the observed spectral shift of light coming from distant objects. This shift arises due to the expansion of space, and can be used to infer the distance of the object and its velocity relative to the observer.

Together, these coordinate systems provide a framework for describing the evolution and structure of the universe since the Big Bang, and are essential tools in modern cosmology.

complementary to the coordinates used to describe the spatial aspects of the universe, there are also coordinates used to describe its temporal evolution. 

One commonly used metric in cosmology is the Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, which describes the expansion of the universe as a function of time. This metric is based on the assumption of a uniform and isotropic universe, and describes the scale factor, which relates the size of the universe at any given time to its initial size at the Big Bang.

Another important concept in cosmology is the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which is a remnant radiation from the Big Bang detected as a faint background of microwaves throughout the universe. The CMB provides a snapshot of the universe as it was about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, and is used to study the properties of the universe during its early evolution.

Overall, the coordinates used in cosmology describe both the spatial and temporal aspects of the evolution of the universe, and are essential for understanding the origin and evolution of the cosmos.

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the oldest light we can observe from the Big Bang, is nearly isotropic, meaning it appears almost the same in all directions. However, there are tiny fluctuations in the temperature of the CMB that reveal important information about the early universe.

The fluctuations in the CMB were mapped in detail by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and later by the Planck Satellite. These maps show that the fluctuations have a specific pattern, with some spots being slightly warmer and others slightly cooler. The pattern of these fluctuations corresponds to the structure that existed in the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang.

So, the direction in which to observe the CMB depends on what we want to study. In general, observations of the CMB are made by using a telescope or a satellite to scan the sky to see the temperature fluctuations.

However, there is no specific direction to look when it comes to observing the CMB. The radiation is coming from all directions in the sky, and the temperature fluctuations are spread out over the entire sky. Scientists have to take measurements from many different locations to get a complete picture of the CMB.

The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) was a spacecraft launched by NASA in 2001 to study the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. For nearly a decade, WMAP mapped the temperature fluctuations of the CMB across the entire sky with unprecedented accuracy, providing detailed information about the early Universe's structure and evolution.

WMAP's observations allowed scientists to make precise measurements of several fundamental cosmological parameters, including the Universe's age, composition, curvature, and expansion rate. The spacecraft confirmed the existence of dark matter and dark energy, two mysterious phenomena that make up roughly 95% of the Universe's total mass-energy.

WMAP was the third NASA spacecraft dedicated to studying the CMB, following the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and the BOOMERanG experiment. In 2013, WMAP's mission ended, and the spacecraft was retired after sending its last set of data back to Earth.

The WMAP data, along with other astronomical observations and theoretical models, have contributed significantly to our current understanding of the Universe's history and evolution.

The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) mission ended in 2010, but the spacecraft continued to operate until 2013, sending data back to Earth until its fuel supply was exhausted. The end of the mission was not caused by any particular event, but rather by the natural limitations of the spacecraft's design and capabilities.

WMAP was designed to operate for a specific duration, to collect a certain amount of data, and to make specific measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The spacecraft successfully completed its mission objectives, achieving unprecedented precision in mapping the CMB's temperature and polarization across the sky and providing important insights into the early Universe's structure and composition.

However, as the spacecraft's fuel supply dwindled, its ability to collect data declined, and it became clear that it would eventually run out of fuel. NASA engineers and scientists decided to end the mission once the data collection was complete, rather than risk damaging the spacecraft or losing its scientific data.

After the end of the WMAP mission, its scientific data became publicly available, allowing scientists around the world to continue analyzing and interpreting the CMB data and further advancing our understanding of the Universe's evolution.

To extend our reach beyond what was achieved by the WMAP mission, several new technologies and techniques have been developed and employed in more recent experiments. These include:

1. Higher resolution detectors: Newer detectors can measure the CMB temperature and polarization fluctuations with greater precision and resolution than the WMAP detectors. These detectors have smaller pixels, better sensitivity, and lower noise levels, allowing for more detailed observations of the CMB.

2. Spectral analysis: One way to extract more information from the CMB is to observe it at different frequencies or wavelengths. By doing so, scientists can better distinguish between different sources of radiation and gain insight into the composition and history of the Universe. This technique has been used in a number of newer experiments, such as Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.

3. Multiple observations and techniques: Rather than relying solely on one instrument or observation technique, many newer experiments employ a mix of different instruments and techniques to cross-check and corroborate their findings. For example, some experiments measure the CMB using ground-based telescopes and space-based telescopes, while also making observations of other cosmic phenomena like galaxy clusters or the large-scale structure of the Universe.

4. Advanced data analysis: With the availability of more powerful computers and sophisticated data analysis techniques, scientists are able to extract more detailed information from the CMB data and model it more accurately. This allows for better constraints on cosmological parameters and more precise tests of theoretical models.

By combining these and other advanced technologies and techniques, newer experiments have been able to achieve much greater sensitivity, accuracy, and coverage than WMAP, gathering data that is providing ever more detailed insights into the structure and history of the Universe.
