Uranium Amalgam (Uranium + Mercury)  

---------------------

# Uranium amalgam   
  - Is an alloy formed by the combination of uranium and mercury.   
     An amalgam is a type of alloy where mercury is the main component,   
      and another metal, in this case, uranium, is the minor component.  
  
    The formation of uranium amalgam occurs due to the strong affinity of mercury towards many metals, including uranium.   
     When the two elements come into contact, the mercury atoms bind with the uranium atoms, forming a solid alloy.    
      The exact composition of the amalgam can vary depending on the ratio of mercury to uranium used in the reaction.    

     - Uranium amalgam has been studied for various purposes,    
        including as a method for the extraction and purification of uranium.   
         It can be used to dissolve or reduce uranium compounds, making it easier to separate uranium from other materials.    
          However, due to the toxicity of mercury and the radioactivity of uranium,    
           the handling and use of uranium amalgam are strictly regulated and require specialized knowledge and safety precautions.    
  
     It's important to note that the use of uranium amalgam is not common outside of specialized research or industrial applications,   
      and it should only be handled by trained professionals in controlled environments due to the hazards associated with both mercury and uranium.
