2. Photon Energy:  
    The equation E = hf, where E represents the energy of a photon, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency,   
     is known as the Planck-Einstein relation or the Einstein relation.   
      This equation was derived by Max Planck and later extended by Albert Einstein to describe the relationship between   
       the energy and frequency of a photon.    
        It is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics and provides a key understanding of the quantized nature of light.   
   
     The energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency and inversely proportional to its wavelength,   
      ccording to the equation E = hf, where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency.   
                  
     In other words, photons with higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) carry more energy,    
      while photons with lower frequencies (longer wavelengths) carry less energy.     
       This relationship is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics and is known as the Planck-Einstein relation.

4. Electromagnetic wave equation:    
    The electromagnetic wave equation relates the electric field (E) and magnetic field (B) components of an   
     electromagnetic wave to their spatial and temporal variations:    
   
       ∇^2E = με∂^2E/∂t^2   
       ∇^2B = με∂^2B/∂t^2   
   where ∇^2 represents the Laplacian operator, μ is the permeability of the medium, ε is the permittivity of the medium, and t is time.

    two different transparent media:   
      
       n₁sin(θ₁) = n₂sin(θ₂)

   where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, k is Boltzmann's constant, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.

   The Stefan-Boltzmann Law describes the total power radiated by a blackbody in terms of its temperature (T):    
    
       P = σAT⁴     
   where P is the total power radiated, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and A is the surface area of the blackbody.

<a id="De-Broglie-wavelength"></a>  
9. De Broglie wavelength:    
    The De Broglie wavelength equation relates the wavelength (λ) of a particle (such as an electron or a photon) to its momentum (p):      
   
       λ = h / p     
   where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle.

10. Index of refraction:     
    The index of refraction (n) of a medium is a measure of how much light slows down when it passes through that medium.    
     It is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (c) to the speed of light in the medium (v):    
   
       n = c / v

11. Fermat's principle:     
    Fermat's principle states that light follows the path that takes the least time to travel between two points.    
     It can be expressed as an equation:    
   
       δt = 0    
   where δt represents the change in time for different paths taken by light.

       tan(θ_p) = n     
   where n is the refractive index of the medium.

    Snell's Law can also be expressed in terms of the refractive indices (n) of two media,   
     relating the sine of the angle of incidence (θ₁) to the sine of the angle of refraction (θ₂):    
     
       n₁sin(θ₁) = n₂sin(θ₂)

<a id="TotalInternalReflection"></a> 
14. Total Internal Reflection:    
    When light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index to a medium with a lower refractive index,   
     there is an angle of incidence (θ_c) at which the light is completely reflected back into the first medium.    
      This critical angle can be calculated using:    
   
       θ_c = sin^(-1)(n₂/n₁)

     It relates the intensity of scattered light (I) to the inverse fourth power of the wavelength (λ) and the scattering angle (θ):     
   
       I = I₀ * ((λ₀/λ)⁴) * ((1 + cos²(θ))/2)

    Huygens' Principle states that every point on a wavefront can be considered as a source of secondary spherical wavelets.
