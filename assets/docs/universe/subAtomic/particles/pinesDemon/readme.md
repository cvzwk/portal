# Pines' demon particle    

is a hypothetical particle that was predicted by theoretical physicist David Pines in 1956. It is a massless, neutral, and non-interacting quasiparticle that can be formed in a solid when electrons in two different energy bands move out of phase with each other. Pines called this particle a "demon" because it is invisible to light and does not interact with other particles.

The existence of Pines' demon particles has been a long-standing mystery in physics. They have never been directly observed, but their properties have been indirectly inferred from experiments. In 2023, a team of researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign announced that they had finally found evidence of Pines' demon particles in the metal strontium ruthenate.

The discovery of Pines' demon particles could have important implications for our understanding of superconductivity. Superconductors are materials that conduct electricity with zero resistance. The mechanism by which superconductivity occurs is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the formation of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons that are bound together by a quantum mechanical force.

Pines' demon particles could play a role in the formation of Cooper pairs. When electrons in two different energy bands move out of phase, they can create a potential well that traps Cooper pairs. This potential well can help to stabilize Cooper pairs and make them more likely to form.

The discovery of Pines' demon particles is a major breakthrough in physics. It could help us to better understand superconductivity and other phenomena in condensed matter physics. It could also lead to the development of new materials with useful properties, such as high-temperature superconductors.

Here are some additional details about Pines' demon particles:

* They are massless, which means that they have no rest mass. This makes them very difficult to detect, as they cannot be slowed down or stopped by any known force.
* They are neutral, which means that they have no electric charge. This also makes them difficult to detect, as they do not interact with electromagnetic fields.
* They are non-interacting, which means that they do not interact with each other or with other particles. This makes them even more difficult to detect, as they cannot be seen or measured in any way.
* They are acoustic, which means that they travel at the speed of sound. This is in contrast to other types of plasmons, which travel at the speed of light.
* They are thought to play a role in superconductivity.

The discovery of Pines' demon particles is a significant step forward in our understanding of the universe. It is a reminder that there is still much that we do not know about the physical world, and that there are still many mysteries to be solved.

* They are thought to be created when electrons in two different energy bands move out of phase with each other. This can happen when the electrons are excited by a photon or by an external electric field.
* Pines' demon particles are very weakly coupled to other particles, which is why they are so difficult to detect. They can only be detected indirectly, by their effects on other particles.
* Pines' demon particles are thought to play a role in superconductivity. When electrons in two different energy bands move out of phase, they can create a potential well that traps Cooper pairs. This potential well can help to stabilize Cooper pairs and make them more likely to form.
* The discovery of Pines' demon particles could have important implications for our understanding of superconductivity and other phenomena in condensed matter physics. It could also lead to the development of new materials with useful properties, such as high-temperature superconductors.

Here are some of the research questions that are still being investigated about Pines' demon particles:

* How are Pines' demon particles created?
* What is the exact nature of the potential well that they create?
* How do Pines' demon particles interact with other particles?
* What is the role of Pines' demon particles in superconductivity?
* Can Pines' demon particles be used to create new materials with useful properties?

The research into Pines' demon particles is still in its early stages, but it is a very exciting field with the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the physical world.

* The discovery of Pines' demon particles was made possible by a technique called momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (MEELs). MEELs is a powerful tool for studying the collective excitations of materials, such as plasmons.
* The researchers used MEELs to study the metal strontium ruthenate. They found evidence of a new type of plasmon that was acoustic, massless, and neutral. This plasmon was consistent with the properties of Pines' demon particles.
* The researchers' findings were published in the journal Nature in August 2023. The paper, titled "Observation of Pines' demon acoustic plasmons in Sr2RuO4," has been widely cited and has generated a lot of excitement in the physics community.

The discovery of Pines' demon particles is a major breakthrough in physics. It could help us to better understand superconductivity and other phenomena in condensed matter physics.

* **High-temperature superconductors:** Superconductors are materials that conduct electricity with zero resistance. This means that they can carry an infinite amount of current without losing any energy. Superconductors have many potential applications, such as in power transmission, medical devices, and quantum computers.

Pines' demon particles could be used to create new materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures. This is the temperature at which a material becomes superconducting. The higher the transition temperature, the more useful the material is for practical applications.

Currently, the highest superconducting transition temperature is about 135 degrees Kelvin (-138 degrees Celsius). Pines' demon particles could be used to create materials with transition temperatures that are much higher than this. This could lead to the development of more efficient and powerful electrical devices.
