# Pines' demon particle    

is a hypothetical particle that was predicted by theoretical physicist David Pines in 1956. It is a massless, neutral, and non-interacting quasiparticle that can be formed in a solid when electrons in two different energy bands move out of phase with each other. Pines called this particle a "demon" because it is invisible to light and does not interact with other particles.

The existence of Pines' demon particles has been a long-standing mystery in physics. They have never been directly observed, but their properties have been indirectly inferred from experiments. In 2023, a team of researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign announced that they had finally found evidence of Pines' demon particles in the metal strontium ruthenate.

The discovery of Pines' demon particles could have important implications for our understanding of superconductivity. Superconductors are materials that conduct electricity with zero resistance. The mechanism by which superconductivity occurs is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the formation of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons that are bound together by a quantum mechanical force.

Pines' demon particles could play a role in the formation of Cooper pairs. When electrons in two different energy bands move out of phase, they can create a potential well that traps Cooper pairs. This potential well can help to stabilize Cooper pairs and make them more likely to form.

The discovery of Pines' demon particles is a major breakthrough in physics. It could help us to better understand superconductivity and other phenomena in condensed matter physics. It could also lead to the development of new materials with useful properties, such as high-temperature superconductors.

Here are some additional details about Pines' demon particles:

* They are massless, which means that they have no rest mass. This makes them very difficult to detect, as they cannot be slowed down or stopped by any known force.
* They are neutral, which means that they have no electric charge. This also makes them difficult to detect, as they do not interact with electromagnetic fields.
* They are non-interacting, which means that they do not interact with each other or with other particles. This makes them even more difficult to detect, as they cannot be seen or measured in any way.
* They are acoustic, which means that they travel at the speed of sound. This is in contrast to other types of plasmons, which travel at the speed of light.
* They are thought to play a role in superconductivity.

The discovery of Pines' demon particles is a significant step forward in our understanding of the universe. It is a reminder that there is still much that we do not know about the physical world, and that there are still many mysteries to be solved.
