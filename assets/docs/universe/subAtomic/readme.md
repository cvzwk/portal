# Subatomic  

means "smaller than an atom." The term is used to describe the smallest particles that make up atoms. These particles are so small that they cannot be seen with a microscope. They can only be studied using particle accelerators and other high-energy machines.

The most common subatomic particles are protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus of the atom, while electrons orbit the nucleus. Protons have a positive charge, neutrons have no charge, and electrons have a negative charge. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus determines the element that the atom is made of. For example, all atoms of hydrogen have one proton in their nucleus, while all atoms of helium have two protons in their nucleus.

Other subatomic particles include quarks, neutrinos, and photons. Quarks are the building blocks of protons and neutrons. Neutrinos are very light particles that interact very weakly with other matter. Photons are massless particles that carry electromagnetic radiation.

Subatomic particles are essential to the understanding of the universe. They play a role in everything from nuclear fusion to the formation of stars. The study of subatomic particles is a fascinating and important field of physics.

Here are some of the key properties of subatomic particles:

* They are very small.
* They have a wide range of masses.
* They can have electric charges, both positive and negative.
* They can interact with each other through the four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force, and the weak force.
* They are very difficult to study because they are so small and elusive.

Subatomic particles are a fascinating and important part of the universe. They play an important role in the structure of matter and the forces that govern the universe. They are a mystery that continues to be studied by physicists around the world.
