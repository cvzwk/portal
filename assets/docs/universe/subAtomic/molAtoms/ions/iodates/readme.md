# Iodates 

Iodates are chemical compounds that contain the iodate ion (IO3-). The iodate ion consists of one iodine atom bonded to three oxygen atoms. Here's some more information about iodates:

- **Iodate Ion (IO3-):**
  - Composition: Iodine (I) + Oxygen (O) x 3
  - Molecular Weight: Approximately 143.9 g/mol
  - Charge: -1
  - Structure: Linear geometry with the iodine atom at the center and the three oxygen atoms surrounding it.

Iodates can form salts with various cations, resulting in compounds like potassium iodate (KIO3) and sodium iodate (NaIO3). These compounds are used in different applications:

- **Potassium Iodate (KIO3):**
  - Molecular Weight: Approximately 214 g/mol
  - Usage: Often used as a source of iodine in iodized salt to prevent iodine deficiency. It's also used in the food industry and as a laboratory reagent.

- **Sodium Iodate (NaIO3):**
  - Molecular Weight: Approximately 197.9 g/mol
  - Usage: Used in analytical chemistry and as a laboratory reagent. It can also be employed in the synthesis of other chemicals.

Iodates and iodine-containing compounds play important roles in various industries, including food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and analytical chemistry. They are also relevant in the field of nuclear energy due to the use of iodine in radiation protection and as a fission product.
