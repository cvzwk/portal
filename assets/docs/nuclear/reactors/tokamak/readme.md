------------------------     

The dimensions of a tokamak's height and radius are influenced by various factors including plasma stability, confinement, and engineering constraints. Although I can't provide an exhaustive set of equations, I can give you a general idea of the relationship between these dimensions:

1. **Aspect Ratio (A)**: The ratio of the major radius (R) to the minor radius (a) of the torus cross-section.

   A = R / a

2. **Plasma Volume (V)**: The volume of the plasma within the torus.

   V = π * a^2 * L

   Here, L is the height of the plasma.

3. **Magnetic Field Strength (B)**: The strength of the magnetic field within the tokamak.

   B = (μ0 * I) / (2 * π * a)

   Here, μ0 is the vacuum permeability, and I is the plasma current.

4. **Confinement Time (τ)**: The time the plasma remains stable within the magnetic field.

   τ = V / (2π * a * L)

These equations provide a simplified overview of how the dimensions of height (L) and radius (a) relate to each other in a tokamak design. In reality, tokamak design is much more complex and involves optimization of these parameters along with considerations for plasma physics, material engineering, and energy confinement.
