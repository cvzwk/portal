The height and radius of the interior of a tokamak are not arbitrary values. They are determined by the physics of fusion reactions and the need to confine the plasma in a stable manner.

The height of the tokamak must be large enough to allow for the formation of a stable plasma column. The radius of the tokamak must be large enough to allow for the plasma to reach the temperatures and densities necessary for fusion reactions to occur.

The optimal values of the height and radius of the interior of a tokamak depend on the specific design of the tokamak and the type of fusion reactions that are being studied. However, in general, the height is typically on the order of meters and the radius is typically on the order of tens of meters.

For example, the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak has a height of 7.5 meters and a radius of 2.9 meters. The ITER tokamak, which is currently under construction in France, will have a height of 10 meters and a radius of 6 meters.

The following table provides some examples of the height and radius of the interior of different tokamaks:

| Tokamak | Height (m) | Radius (m) |
|---|---|---|
| Joint European Torus (JET) | 7.5 | 2.9 |
| ITER | 10 | 6 |
| Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV) | 2.5 | 1.3 |
| Alcator C-Mod | 1.4 | 0.8 |

As you can see, the height and radius of the interior of a tokamak can vary significantly depending on the specific design of the tokamak and the type of fusion reactions that are being studied. However, in general, the height is typically on the order of meters and the radius is typically on the order of tens of meters.

The dimensions of a tokamak's height and radius are influenced by various factors including plasma stability, confinement, and engineering constraints. Although I can't provide an exhaustive set of equations, I can give you a general idea of the relationship between these dimensions:

1. **Aspect Ratio (A)**: The ratio of the major radius (R) to the minor radius (a) of the torus cross-section.

   A = R / a

2. **Plasma Volume (V)**: The volume of the plasma within the torus.

   V = π * a^2 * L

   Here, L is the height of the plasma.

3. **Magnetic Field Strength (B)**: The strength of the magnetic field within the tokamak.

   B = (μ0 * I) / (2 * π * a)

   Here, μ0 is the vacuum permeability, and I is the plasma current.

4. **Confinement Time (τ)**: The time the plasma remains stable within the magnetic field.

   τ = V / (2π * a * L)

These equations provide a simplified overview of how the dimensions of height (L) and radius (a) relate to each other in a tokamak design. In reality, tokamak design is much more complex and involves optimization of these parameters along with considerations for plasma physics, material engineering, and energy confinement.

# My Custom Tokamak, Theorically   

- Objectives:   
  - Support:      
    - 666Millions Of °C     
    - 1 Tonnes or More of Hot Plasma
    
The dimensional values of a tokamak that can support 1 tonne of hot plasma with 666 million degrees Celsius are not yet known. This is because tokamaks that can achieve these conditions are still in the early stages of development.

However, some estimates suggest that a tokamak with a height of at least 100 meters and a radius of at least 30 meters would be required to support 1 tonne of hot plasma with 666 million degrees Celsius. The tokamak would also need to be surrounded by a strong magnetic field to confine the plasma.

The development of tokamaks that can achieve these conditions is a major challenge, but it is an important goal for the future of nuclear fusion power. If tokamaks can be successfully developed, they could provide a clean, safe, and abundant source of energy.

Here are some additional considerations for the dimensional values of a tokamak that can support 1 tonne of hot plasma with 666 million degrees Celsius:

* The tokamak would need to be made of materials that can withstand the high temperatures and pressures of the plasma.
* The tokamak would need to be cooled to prevent the plasma from melting the walls of the reactor.
* The tokamak would need to be equipped with a system to remove the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions.

The development of tokamaks that can support 1 tonne of hot plasma with 666 million degrees Celsius is a major challenge, but it is an important goal for the future of nuclear fusion power. If tokamaks can be successfully developed, they could provide a clean, safe, and abundant source of energy.

- Thickness Walls:
The thickness of the walls of a tokamak that can support 1 tonne of hot plasma with 666 million degrees Celsius is not yet known. This is because tokamaks that can achieve these conditions are still in the early stages of development.

However, some estimates suggest that the walls of the tokamak would need to be at least 7.5 meter thick to withstand the heat and pressure of the plasma. The walls would also need to be made of a material that is resistant to radiation damage, such as tungsten or beryllium.

The thickness of the walls of a tokamak is also affected by the design of the tokamak. For example, tokamaks with a higher magnetic field strength can have thinner walls because the magnetic field helps to confine the plasma.

The development of tokamaks that can support 1 tonne of hot plasma with 666 million degrees Celsius is a major challenge, but it is an important goal for the future of nuclear fusion power. If tokamaks can be successfully developed, they could provide a clean, safe, and abundant source of energy.

Here are some additional considerations for the thickness of the walls of a tokamak that can support 1 tonne of hot plasma with 666 million degrees Celsius:

* The walls would need to be able to withstand the heat and pressure of the plasma without melting.
* The walls would need to be resistant to radiation damage.
* The walls would need to be made of a material that is compatible with the magnetic field.

The thickness of the walls of a tokamak is a critical design consideration for tokamaks that are designed to achieve fusion conditions. The walls need to be thick enough to withstand the heat and pressure of the plasma, but they also need to be thin enough to allow the magnetic field to confine the plasma. The development of new materials and technologies that can meet these requirements is essential for the progress of fusion research.
