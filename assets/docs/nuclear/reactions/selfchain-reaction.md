One possible theory for a self-sustaining chain reaction of fission and fusion involving hydrogen can be described as follows:

1. Start with a source of hydrogen isotopes, primarily deuterium (D) and tritium (T). Deuterium can be extracted from seawater, while tritium may be bred within the reactor by the absorption of neutrons by lithium-6 (Li-6).

2. The first step is the initiation of a fission chain reaction. This can be achieved by surrounding the hydrogen isotopes with a fissile material, such as enriched uranium or plutonium. Neutrons emitted during the fission process will interact with the hydrogen isotopes, leading to the release of energy and the production of helium-4 and more neutrons.

3. These neutrons, along with the unreacted hydrogen isotopes, will be absorbed by a blanket of lithium-6 surrounding the fissile material. The absorption of neutrons by lithium-6 will produce helium-4 and tritium.

4. The tritium produced from the lithium-6 blanket will be injected back into the core, creating a fusion fuel source. A mixture of deuterium and tritium will be heated to high temperatures (tens of millions of degrees) using techniques such as magnetic confinement or laser-induced inertial fusion.

5. The fusion of deuterium and tritium will result in the release of large amounts of energy in the form of high-energy neutrons, helium-4, and excess tritium. These neutrons can then interact with the surrounding fissile material, sustaining the fission chain reaction and producing more energy.

6. Additionally, the high-energy neutrons produced during the fusion reactions will also interact with the lithium-6 blanket, generating more tritium, which can be injected back into the fusion core, creating a self-sustaining cycle.

This theory suggests a self-sustaining chain reaction in which the fission reactions provide the initial energy and neutrons needed to sustain the fusion reactions, while the fusion reactions help breed tritium, which in turn fuels the fusion reactions. However, it is worth noting that achieving and maintaining a self-sustaining chain reaction of fission and fusion is a complex and challenging undertaking that requires further research and development.
