When a nucleus undergoes fission, it breaks up into two or more smaller fragments. These fragments are called fission products, and many of them are radioactive. The fission of uranium or plutonium produces a wide range of fission products, including:

- Radioactive isotopes of elements such as cesium, strontium, iodine, xenon, krypton, and molybdenum. These isotopes decay by emitting alpha, beta, or gamma radiation, and some of them have long half-lives, making them hazardous for thousands of years.

- Neutrons that can be absorbed by other nuclei and trigger additional fission events. This is how a nuclear chain reaction is sustained in a nuclear reactor or a nuclear bomb.

- Heat energy that can be used to produce electricity or kinetic energy.

The fission of thorium produces similar byproducts, including radioactive isotopes of elements like iodine, strontium, and cesium.

It is important to note that different fission reactions produce different sets of fission products, and the specific mix of fission products depends on factors such as the type of fuel, the conditions of the fission reaction, and the amount of time that has elapsed since the fission occurred. Proper management and disposal of fission products are crucial to prevent exposure to radiation and minimize environmental impacts
