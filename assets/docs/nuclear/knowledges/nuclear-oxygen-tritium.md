Certainly! Let's consider an alternative nuclear reaction to produce oxygen (O2) without involving radioactive emissions:     
    
  1. Start with a source of tritium (T), which can be obtained from certain nuclear reactions or produced in specialized facilities.      

  2. Initiate a nuclear fusion reaction between tritium (T) and deuterium (D) to produce a helium-4 (He-4) nucleus and a neutron (n):      

         T + D -> He-4 + n       

  3. Capture the neutron (n) produced in step 2 and react it with another tritium (T) nucleus to form a helium-4 (He-4) nucleus and a proton (H+):      

         n + T -> He-4 + H+      

  4. Combine the helium-4 (He-4) nucleus and the proton (H+) to form beryllium-5 (Be-5):     

         He-4 + H+ -> Be-5     

  5. Allow the beryllium-5 (Be-5) to undergo beta decay, transforming into lithium-5 (Li-5) and emitting an electron (e-) and an antineutrino (ν̄):     

         Be-5 -> Li-5 + e- + ν̄     

  6. Capture the emitted electron (e-) and react it with a proton (H+) to produce a neutron (n):    

         e- + H+ -> n    

  7. Combine the neutron (n) with another tritium (T) nucleus to generate a helium-4 (He-4) nucleus and a proton (H+):     

         n + T -> He-4 + H+    

  8. React the proton (H+) with another helium-4 (He-4) nucleus to produce oxygen-16 (O-16):     

         H+ + He-4 -> O-16    

By following this alternative series of nuclear reactions,   
 oxygen-16 (O-16) can be produced without involving radioactive emissions.   
  However, it's important to note that this process is still theoretical and not currently achievable using practical methods.
