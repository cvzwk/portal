Thermobaric explosives, also known as fuel-air explosives (FAE), are a type of explosive weapon that utilizes a combination of air and fuel to create an intense blast and shockwave. These explosives work by dispersing a cloud of fuel (often a fine mist or powder) into the air and then igniting it. The resulting explosion produces a highly destructive blast that can cause significant damage to structures, equipment, and personnel within the blast radius.

Unlike traditional explosives that rely solely on their own stored oxygen for combustion, thermobaric explosives take advantage of the oxygen present in the surrounding air. The fuel-air mixture forms a cloud that spreads over a wide area, effectively filling the available space and increasing the blast's destructive potential. When ignited, the fuel-air mixture rapidly burns, generating a shockwave that can cause extensive damage.

Thermobaric explosives are particularly effective in confined spaces, such as buildings, tunnels, or caves, where the shockwave can be amplified due to the enclosed environment. They are often used in military applications and can be designed for various purposes, including anti-personnel, anti-vehicle, and anti-structure operations.

It's important to note that the use of thermobaric explosives has ethical and humanitarian implications due to their potential for causing indiscriminate damage and harm to civilians. These explosives have been a subject of debate regarding their use in warfare and conflicts.
