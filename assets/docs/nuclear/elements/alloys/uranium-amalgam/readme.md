# Uranium amalgam   
  - Is an alloy formed by the combination of uranium and mercury.   
     An amalgam is a type of alloy where mercury is the main component,   
      and another metal, in this case, uranium, is the minor component.  
  
    The formation of uranium amalgam occurs due to the strong affinity of mercury towards many metals, including uranium.   
     When the two elements come into contact, the mercury atoms bind with the uranium atoms, forming a solid alloy.    
      The exact composition of the amalgam can vary depending on the ratio of mercury to uranium used in the reaction.    

     - Uranium amalgam has been studied for various purposes,    
        including as a method for the extraction and purification of uranium.   
         It can be used to dissolve or reduce uranium compounds, making it easier to separate uranium from other materials.    
          However, due to the toxicity of mercury and the radioactivity of uranium,    
           the handling and use of uranium amalgam are strictly regulated and require specialized knowledge and safety precautions.    
  
     It's important to note that the use of uranium amalgam is not common outside of specialized research or industrial applications,   
      and it should only be handled by trained professionals in controlled environments due to the hazards associated with both mercury and uranium.

# The density of an alloy 
   consisting of uranium and mercury, commonly referred to as uranium amalgam,   
    can vary depending on the specific composition and proportions of the two elements.   
     However, since uranium is significantly denser than mercury,  
      the density of the amalgam will be closer to that of uranium.

   The density of uranium is approximately 19,050 kg/m³.   
    On the other hand, mercury has a density of approximately 13,534 kg/m³.   
     When combined, the resulting density of the uranium amalgam would be expected to fall somewhere between these two values,    
      depending on the ratio of uranium to mercury in the alloy.   

It's worth noting that the specific density of a uranium amalgam can be challenging to determine precisely due    
 to the nature of the mixture and the potential for variations in composition.    
  The density can also be influenced by factors such as temperature and pressure.   

Creating this alloy:  
For first is necessary define the objective as model of object, radius/size, thickness to then define the amount of each material used in the composition:  
In this example i used the sphere shape.   

To calculate the amount of each material needed to create a sphere based on the desired radius and thickness using uranium mercury alloy (uranium amalgam),   
 a few factors need to be considered.

1. Sphere Volume:   
    The first step is to determine the volume of the sphere you want to create.   
     The formula for calculating the volume of a sphere is:    

    V = (4/3) * π * r³   

    Where V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere.   

2. Desired Thickness:  
    If you want to create the sphere with a specific thickness, you will need to adjust the sphere's radius accordingly.    
     The radius of the outer sphere will be equal to the inner radius plus the desired thickness.   

3. Composition of the alloy:   
    As mentioned earlier, uranium amalgam is composed primarily of uranium, with a small amount of mercury.    
     The exact ratio may vary depending on the specific purpose of the amalgam.    
      It is recommended to obtain detailed information about the desired ratio before carrying out any calculations.    

4. Alloy Density:   
    As the density of uranium amalgam is not easily determined due to many possible ratios and conditions,   
     it is necessary to obtain specific information about the density of the amalgam you wish to use.   
      Density is measured in kg/m³.

Once you have the alloy density, sphere volume, and desired thickness,    
 you can calculate the approximate amounts of uranium and mercury needed to create the sphere according to the desired alloy composition.   
  Remember to follow all safety precautions when handling hazardous materials such as uranium and mercury and consult experts or reputable sources    
   before proceeding with any experiments involving these substances.
