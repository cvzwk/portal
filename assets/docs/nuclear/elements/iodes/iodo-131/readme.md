# Iodine-131 (I-131)   
is typically produced in nuclear reactors through a process called neutron activation.   
 Here's a brief overview of how it's produced:    
  
1. Uranium-235 fission:   
    The process starts with the fission of uranium-235 (U-235) in a nuclear reactor.   
     During the fission process, U-235 nuclei split into two smaller fragments, along with the release of neutrons.   
   
3. Neutron absorption:
    Some of the neutrons released during U-235 fission are absorbed by stable iodine-130
     (I-130) nuclei present in the reactor's environment.   

5. Conversion to Iodine-131:
    When a neutron is absorbed by an I-130 nucleus, it undergoes a series of transformations, emitting a beta particle (electron) in the process.   
     This results in the conversion of I-130 into radioactive iodine-131 (I-131).    

7. Isolation and purification:
    The produced I-131 needs to be isolated and purified from other radioactive isotopes and contaminants before it can be used for medical purposes.
