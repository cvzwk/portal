# Chemical VX    
 is a highly toxic nerve agent, one of the deadliest chemical substances ever synthesized.   
  It can be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin,    
   causing severe effects on the nervous system and leading to paralysis and potentially death.    
    VX is classified as a chemical weapon and its production, stockpiling, and use are strictly prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention.    
     If you have any questions or need further information about VX, feel free to ask.   

# The chemical composition of VX is as follows:   
   
- The full name of VX is "O-ethyl S-[2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl] methylphosphonothioate."   
- It belongs to the organophosphate family of chemical compounds.    
- VX is an organic molecule containing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms.    
   
Please note that VX is a highly dangerous substance,     

# The precise amount of each element in VX  
 can be described by its chemical formula: C11H26NO2PS.  

Here's a breakdown of the elements and their corresponding number of atoms in one molecule of VX:   
   
- Carbon (C) - 11 atoms   
- Hydrogen (H) - 26 atoms   
- Nitrogen (N) - 1 atom    
- Oxygen (O) - 2 atoms   
- Phosphorus (P) - 1 atom    
- Sulfur (S) - 1 atom   
    
Keep in mind that VX is an extremely hazardous chemical
