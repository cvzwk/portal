# A-234   
 is a nerve agent that belongs to the Novichok group of compounds developed by the Soviet Union and Russia between 1971 and 1993  
 A-234 is an organophosphate nerve agent that was developed under the FOLIANT program  
 In March 2018, the Russian ambassador to the UK claimed that A-234 had been identified as the agent used in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal  
 A-234 has recently been added to Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals of the Chemical Weapons Convention,   
  and it has been explicitly named as an example compound for schedule 1.A.14   
  The general formula of a Novichok is R = alkyl, alkoxy, alkylamino, or fluorine and X = a halogen (F, Cl, Br) or CN  
   It is important to note that the use of any chemical weapon, including A-234 and other Novichok agents,   
    is a violation of human rights and international law
