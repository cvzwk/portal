# Sarin gas   

 also known as GB (G-series, 'B'), is a highly toxic nerve agent.   
  Its chemical composition is as follows:    
   
   - Chemical formula: C4H10FO2P   
   - IUPAC name: (RS)-Propan-2-yl methylphosphonofluoridate   
   - Structural formula: CH3-PO(F)(OCH(CH3)2)   
    
Sarin is a clear, colorless, and volatile liquid at room temperature,   
but it can also be dispersed as an aerosol.    
It is chemically similar to certain insecticides and belongs to a class of chemicals called organophosphates,      
which act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, leading to the accumulation of acetylcholine and causing overstimulation of the nervous system.      
This results in severe symptoms and can be lethal in high doses.       
Sarin is extremely hazardous and has been banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention due to its potential for mass destruction and harm to human health.
