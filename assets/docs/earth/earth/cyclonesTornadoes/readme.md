# Tornadoes and cyclones   

are both rotating columns of air, but they form in different ways and have different characteristics.

* **Tornadoes** form when thunderstorms produce strong vertical wind shear, which is a change in wind speed or direction with height. The wind shear causes the thunderstorm to rotate, and if the rotation becomes strong enough, a tornado can form. Tornadoes typically form in the United States, but they can also occur in other parts of the world.

* **Cyclones** form over warm ocean waters when warm, moist air rises and cools. As the air cools, it condenses and releases latent heat, which further drives the upward motion of the air. The rising air creates a low-pressure center, and the air around the low-pressure center flows in to fill the void. This inflow of air is what creates the rotating motion of a cyclone. Cyclones can form in any ocean basin, but they are most common in the tropics.

Both tornadoes and cyclones can be destructive, but tornadoes are typically more violent. Tornadoes can reach wind speeds of up to 300 miles per hour, while cyclones typically have wind speeds of 100-150 miles per hour. Tornadoes are also smaller than cyclones, typically only a few hundred yards wide, while cyclones can be hundreds of miles wide.

Here is a table that summarizes the differences between tornadoes and cyclones:

| Feature | Tornado | Cyclone |
|---|---|---|
| Location | United States, other parts of the world | Warm ocean waters |
| Cause | Strong vertical wind shear | Warm, moist air rising and cooling |
| Wind speed | Up to 300 miles per hour | 100-150 miles per hour |
| Size | Few hundred yards wide | Hundreds of miles wide |
| Destructive potential | High | High
