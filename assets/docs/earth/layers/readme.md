The Earth is composed of several layers, each with distinct characteristics and compositions. These layers are typically divided into the following major zones:

1. **Crust**: The outermost layer of the Earth is called the crust. It is relatively thin compared to the other layers and ranges in thickness from about 5 to 70 kilometers (3 to 44 miles). There are two types of crust: continental crust, which underlies the continents, and oceanic crust, which underlies the ocean basins. The crust is made up of rocks and minerals and is where most of our everyday activities take place.

2. **Mantle**: The mantle is the layer located beneath the crust and extends to a depth of about 2,890 kilometers (1,800 miles). It is the thickest layer of the Earth and is primarily composed of solid rock, but it can flow slowly over geological timescales like a viscous fluid. The upper part of the mantle is called the asthenosphere, where the movement of the semi-molten rock material helps drive plate tectonics.

3. **Outer Core**: The outer core is a liquid layer that lies beneath the mantle and extends from about 2,890 kilometers (1,800 miles) to 5,150 kilometers (3,200 miles) below the Earth's surface. It is mainly composed of iron and nickel, and it is in this layer that the movement of the liquid metal generates Earth's magnetic field through the geodynamo process.

4. **Inner Core**: The innermost layer of the Earth is the inner core. It is a solid ball of iron and nickel with a radius of about 1,220 kilometers (760 miles). Despite being incredibly hot (temperatures can reach up to several thousand degrees Celsius), immense pressure keeps the iron-nickel alloy in a solid state.

This layered structure of the Earth is known as the Earth's structure or internal structure. It plays a crucial role in various geophysical processes, including plate tectonics, volcanic activity, and the generation of the magnetic field. Understanding the different layers helps scientists and geologists study the Earth's behavior and its dynamic processes.
