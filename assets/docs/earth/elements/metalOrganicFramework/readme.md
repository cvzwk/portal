# Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs)   

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials composed of metal ions or clusters linked by organic ligands. These materials are known for their high surface areas, tunable pore sizes, and remarkable adsorption capacities. The combination of metal nodes and organic linkers creates a highly ordered and crystalline structure.

Key features of metal-organic frameworks include:

1. Porous Structure: MOFs have a three-dimensional network of pores and channels, providing a large internal surface area for gas adsorption and storage.

2. High Surface Area: MOFs can have incredibly high specific surface areas, sometimes exceeding thousands of square meters per gram. This makes them attractive for applications like gas storage and separation.

3. Tunable Pore Size and Functionality: By selecting specific metal ions and organic linkers, researchers can design MOFs with tailored pore sizes and functionalities, making them suitable for various applications.

4. Versatility: MOFs can be designed to accommodate a wide range of guest molecules, including gases, liquids, and even large biomolecules.

5. Applications: MOFs have diverse applications, including gas storage, separation, catalysis, drug delivery, sensors, and environmental remediation.

6. Synthesis: MOFs can be synthesized using solvothermal, hydrothermal, or other methods, and the choice of metal ions and organic linkers determines the final structure and properties.

Due to their impressive properties, MOFs have gained significant attention from researchers in various fields, and they continue to be studied for their potential in solving real-world challenges. As a rapidly evolving area of research, new MOFs with unique properties and applications are continuously being discovered and developed.

| MOF | Molecular Weight (g/mol) |
|---|---|
| HKUST-1 | 1,511.30 |
| MIL-100 | 1,495.10 |
| UiO-66 | 1,467.30 |
| ZIF-8 | 1,391.40 |
| MOF-5 | 1,369.30 |
| MIL-53 | 1,359.20 |
| NU-100 | 1,341.10 |
| MIL-47 | 1,323.10 |
| HKUST-2 | 1,315.00 |
| ZIF-67 | 1,303.30 |

This is not an exhaustive list of MOFs, and the molecular weight of a particular MOF may vary depending on the specific metal and organic linkers used. However, it gives a good overview of the range of molecular weights that MOFs can have.

MOFs are a class of materials that are made up of metal ions and organic linkers. They are often used for gas storage and separation, catalysis, and sensing. The molecular weight of a MOF can affect its properties in these applications. For example, MOFs with higher molecular weights tend to have higher gas uptake capacities.
