# Hydrides   

Hydrides are chemical compounds formed when hydrogen combines with other elements. They can be broadly classified into three main types:

1. Ionic Hydrides: These hydrides are formed when hydrogen reacts with highly electropositive metals, such as alkali and alkaline earth metals. In ionic hydrides, hydrogen gains an electron to become a hydride ion (H^-), and it forms ionic bonds with the metal cation. Ionic hydrides tend to be highly reactive and are good reducing agents.

2. Covalent Hydrides: Covalent hydrides result from the combination of hydrogen with elements that are more electronegative than hydrogen, such as nonmetals like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. In covalent hydrides, hydrogen shares electrons with the other element, forming covalent bonds. These hydrides can vary in properties from molecular gases (e.g., methane, CH4) to solids (e.g., ammonia, NH3).

3. Metallic Hydrides: Metallic hydrides form when hydrogen interacts with transition metals and some other metals. The hydrogen atoms occupy the interstitial spaces in the metal lattice, leading to various properties such as hydrogen storage capabilities. Metallic hydrides are important in hydrogen storage technologies.

Hydrides have diverse applications across different fields, including hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen storage materials, and metal-catalyzed reactions. Understanding the properties and behavior of hydrides is essential for advancing various technological and industrial applications related to hydrogen and its compounds.

- Hcp-YH3: This is the yttrium hydride with the highest hydrogen content under ambient conditions.
- Other potential high-power hydrides: Lanthanum hydride and other yttrium hydrides at high pressure have been studied and show promise for high power applications.
* **LaH3** (lanthanum hydride)
* **LiBH4** (lithium borohydride)
* **NaBH4** (sodium borohydride)
* **MgH2** (magnesium hydride)
* **TiH2** (titanium hydride)
* **ZrH2** (zirconium hydride)
* **YH2** (yttrium hydride)
* **VH2** (vanadium hydride)
* **NbH2** (niobium hydride)
* **TaH2** (tantalum hydride)
* **CrH2** (chromium hydride)
* **MoH2** (molybdenum hydride)
* **W**(H2) (tungsten hydride)

This list is based on the most recent research on hydrides, and it is likely that new hydrides with even greater strength will be discovered in the future.

Please note that the strength of a hydride depends on a number of factors, including the type of metal, the hydrogen content, and the temperature. As research in this area continues, it is likely that new hydrides with even greater strength will be discovered.

# Li2MgH3:     

**Composition**

* Lithium: 26.7 g/mol
* Magnesium: 24.3 g/mol
* Hydrogen: 48.9 g/mol

**Properties**

* Molecular weight: 99.9 g/mol
* Melting point: 450°C
* Boiling point: 1,250°C
* Density: 1.2 g/cm3
* Heat of formation: -75 kJ/mol

Li2MgH3 is a strong, lightweight hydride that is being studied for a variety of applications. It has a high hydrogen content, which makes it a potential candidate for rocket fuel and hydrogen storage. It is also more stable at high temperatures than other hydrides, which makes it a promising material for metal additive applications.

However, Li2MgH3 is still under development, and there are some challenges that need to be overcome before it can be used in commercial applications. For example, it is not as energy-dense as other hydrides, and it is also more expensive to produce.

Despite these challenges, Li2MgH3 is a promising material with the potential to revolutionize the way we use hydrogen. As research in this area continues, it is likely that Li2MgH3 will become a more viable option for a variety of applications.

# Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4),    
also known as LAH, is a strong reducing agent. It is a white, solid compound that is soluble in diethyl ether and THF. LAH is used in organic synthesis to reduce aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, nitriles, amides, and epoxides to the corresponding alcohols, amines, and alkanes.

LAH is a more powerful reducing agent than sodium borohydride (NaBH4) because the Al-H bond in LAH is more polar. This means that the electrons in the bond are more likely to be shared with the hydride ion, making LAH more reactive.

LAH is also more stable than NaBH4 at high temperatures. This makes it a more versatile reducing agent, as it can be used in a wider range of reactions.

However, LAH is also more hazardous than NaBH4. It is pyrophoric, meaning that it can ignite spontaneously in air. It is also corrosive to skin and eyes.

As a result, LAH should be handled with care. It should be stored in a cool, dry place and away from heat and light. It should also be used in a well-ventilated area.

Here are some of the applications of LiAlH4:

* **Organic synthesis:** LAH is used in organic synthesis to reduce aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, nitriles, amides, and epoxides to the corresponding alcohols, amines, and alkanes.
* **Hydrogen storage:** LAH can be used to store hydrogen. When LAH is reacted with water, it releases hydrogen gas. This makes it a potential candidate for hydrogen fuel cells.
* **Metal refining:** LAH can be used to refine metals. It can be used to remove impurities from metals, such as iron and copper.

LiAlH4 is a versatile and powerful reducing agent with a wide range of applications. However, it is also hazardous and should be handled with care.
