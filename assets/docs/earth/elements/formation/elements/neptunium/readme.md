# Neptunium  

Neptunium is a synthetic element, which means it is not naturally occurring and is created through artificial processes. It was the first synthetic transuranium element to be produced, and its discovery played a significant role in advancing our understanding of nuclear physics and the behavior of heavy elements.

Neptunium was first synthesized in 1940 by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson at the University of California, Berkeley, United States. They bombarded uranium-238 (^238U) with high-energy neutrons in a cyclotron, leading to the absorption of a neutron by a ^238U nucleus, which resulted in the formation of ^239U (uranium-239).

^239U is a highly unstable isotope and undergoes beta decay, emitting an electron and transforming into ^239Np (neptunium-239):

^239U + neutron → ^239Np + electron + antineutrino

The discovery of neptunium marked the first time a transuranium element had been intentionally synthesized. It was named after the planet Neptune, which is located beyond Uranus in our solar system. The discovery of neptunium opened the door to further research and the production of other transuranium elements, leading to a deeper understanding of nuclear reactions and the development of nuclear technology.

high-temperature mass spectrometric measurements on neptunium dioxide (NpO2).   
The study involves analyzing the vaporization behavior of pure neptunium dioxide samples under vacuum and oxidative conditions, as well as investigating the behavior of neptunium in americium dioxide and plutonium-americium mixed oxide samples with very small amounts of neptunium.   

Some key points from the study include:

1. Vapor Pressure Measurements: The researchers measured the vapor pressure of pure neptunium dioxide samples under different conditions.

2. Extreme Dilution of Neptunium: In the mixed oxide samples containing small amounts of neptunium, it is mentioned that Raoult's law has been applied. Raoult's law relates the vapor pressure of an ideal solution to the mole fraction of the components present.

3. Ionization Efficiency Curves: The study recorded ionization efficiency curves for different ion species like Np+, NpO+, and NpO2+ at a constant temperature.

4. Dissociative Ionization Contribution: The researchers evaluated the contribution of dissociative ionization with respect to the composition of the gaseous phase, which is in equilibrium with the condensed phase under Knudsen conditions. Knudsen conditions refer to the condition where the vapor pressure and partial pressure are in equilibrium during mass spectrometric analysis in a Knudsen cell.

5. Journal and Publisher: The study is published in a journal with the title not provided. The publisher is ACADEMIC PRESS LTD-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD.

1° - Critical role of water content in the formation and reactivity of uranium, neptunium, and plutonium iodates under hydrothermal conditions: implications for the oxidative dissolution of spent nuclear fuel.    
[External URL](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ic070170d)   

Original Paper:   
The reactions of 237NpO2 with excess iodate under acidic hydrothermal conditions result in the isolation of the neptunium(IV), neptunium(V), and neptunium(VI) iodates, Np(IO3)4, Np(IO3)4.nH2O.nHIO3, NpO2(IO3), NpO2(IO3)2(H2O), and NpO2(IO3)2.H2O, depending on both the pH and the amount of water present in the reactions. Reactions with less water and lower pH favor reduced products. Although the initial redox processes involved in the reactions between 237NpO2 or 242PuO2 and iodate are similar, the low solubility of Pu(IO3)4 dominates product formation in plutonium iodate reactions to a much greater extent than does Np(IO3)4 in the neptunium iodate system. UO2 reacts with iodate under these conditions to yield uranium(VI) iodates solely. The isotypic structures of the actinide(IV) iodates, An(IO3)4 (An=Np, Pu), are reported and consist of one-dimensional chains of dodecahedral An(IV) cations bridged by iodate anions. The structure of Np(IO3)4.nH2O.nHIO3 is constructed from NpO9 tricapped-trigonal prisms that are bridged by iodate into a polar three-dimensional framework structure. Second-harmonic-generation measurements on a polycrystalline sample of the Th analogue of Np(IO3)4.nH2O.nHIO3 reveal a response of approximately 12x that of alpha-SiO2. Single-crystal magnetic susceptibility measurements of Np(IO3)4 show magnetically isolated Np(IV) ions.

Detailing the paper:  
It seems that the text you provided is a technical description of a scientific study involving the reactions of neptunium, plutonium, and uranium oxides with iodate under specific conditions. The study discusses the formation of various iodate compounds, including neptunium(IV), neptunium(V), and neptunium(VI) iodates, and how the reaction outcomes are influenced by factors such as pH and the amount of water present.

In summary:

1. Neptunium(IV), neptunium(V), and neptunium(VI) iodates (Np(IO3)4, Np(IO3)4.nH2O.nHIO3, NpO2(IO3), NpO2(IO3)2(H2O), and NpO2(IO3)2.H2O) are formed depending on pH and water content during the reaction with iodate.

2. Similar redox processes are involved in the reactions of neptunium dioxide (237NpO2) and plutonium dioxide (242PuO2) with iodate. However, the low solubility of plutonium iodate (Pu(IO3)4) leads to a greater dominance of product formation in plutonium iodate reactions compared to neptunium iodate reactions.

3. Uranium dioxide (UO2) reacts with iodate to yield uranium(VI) iodates exclusively.

4. The structures of actinide(IV) iodates, An(IO3)4 (An=Np, Pu), are reported and consist of one-dimensional chains of dodecahedral An(IV) cations bridged by iodate anions.

5. The structure of Np(IO3)4.nH2O.nHIO3 involves NpO9 tricapped-trigonal prisms bridged by iodate, forming a polar three-dimensional framework structure.

6. The Th analogue of Np(IO3)4.nH2O.nHIO3 shows a significant second-harmonic-generation response.

7. Single-crystal magnetic susceptibility measurements of Np(IO3)4 reveal magnetically isolated Np(IV) ions.

Overall, this text provides a detailed insight into the chemistry and structural properties of the iodate compounds formed in the reactions of certain actinide oxides under specific hydrothermal conditions. It is important to note that this is a technical description targeted towards researchers and scientists in the field of chemistry and materials science.
