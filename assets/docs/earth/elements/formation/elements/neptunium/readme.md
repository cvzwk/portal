# Neptunium  

Neptunium is a synthetic element, which means it is not naturally occurring and is created through artificial processes. It was the first synthetic transuranium element to be produced, and its discovery played a significant role in advancing our understanding of nuclear physics and the behavior of heavy elements.

Neptunium was first synthesized in 1940 by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson at the University of California, Berkeley, United States. They bombarded uranium-238 (^238U) with high-energy neutrons in a cyclotron, leading to the absorption of a neutron by a ^238U nucleus, which resulted in the formation of ^239U (uranium-239).

^239U is a highly unstable isotope and undergoes beta decay, emitting an electron and transforming into ^239Np (neptunium-239):

^239U + neutron → ^239Np + electron + antineutrino

The discovery of neptunium marked the first time a transuranium element had been intentionally synthesized. It was named after the planet Neptune, which is located beyond Uranus in our solar system. The discovery of neptunium opened the door to further research and the production of other transuranium elements, leading to a deeper understanding of nuclear reactions and the development of nuclear technology.

high-temperature mass spectrometric measurements on neptunium dioxide (NpO2).   
The study involves analyzing the vaporization behavior of pure neptunium dioxide samples under vacuum and oxidative conditions, as well as investigating the behavior of neptunium in americium dioxide and plutonium-americium mixed oxide samples with very small amounts of neptunium.   

Some key points from the study include:

1. Vapor Pressure Measurements: The researchers measured the vapor pressure of pure neptunium dioxide samples under different conditions.

2. Extreme Dilution of Neptunium: In the mixed oxide samples containing small amounts of neptunium, it is mentioned that Raoult's law has been applied. Raoult's law relates the vapor pressure of an ideal solution to the mole fraction of the components present.

3. Ionization Efficiency Curves: The study recorded ionization efficiency curves for different ion species like Np+, NpO+, and NpO2+ at a constant temperature.

4. Dissociative Ionization Contribution: The researchers evaluated the contribution of dissociative ionization with respect to the composition of the gaseous phase, which is in equilibrium with the condensed phase under Knudsen conditions. Knudsen conditions refer to the condition where the vapor pressure and partial pressure are in equilibrium during mass spectrometric analysis in a Knudsen cell.

# Public Paper's about Neptunium:  

1° - Critical role of water content in the formation and reactivity of uranium, neptunium, and plutonium iodates under hydrothermal conditions: implications for the oxidative dissolution of spent nuclear fuel.    
[External URL](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ic070170d)   

Original Paper:   
The reactions of 237NpO2 with excess iodate under acidic hydrothermal conditions result in the isolation of the neptunium(IV), neptunium(V), and neptunium(VI) iodates, Np(IO3)4, Np(IO3)4.nH2O.nHIO3, NpO2(IO3), NpO2(IO3)2(H2O), and NpO2(IO3)2.H2O, depending on both the pH and the amount of water present in the reactions. Reactions with less water and lower pH favor reduced products. Although the initial redox processes involved in the reactions between 237NpO2 or 242PuO2 and iodate are similar, the low solubility of Pu(IO3)4 dominates product formation in plutonium iodate reactions to a much greater extent than does Np(IO3)4 in the neptunium iodate system. UO2 reacts with iodate under these conditions to yield uranium(VI) iodates solely. The isotypic structures of the actinide(IV) iodates, An(IO3)4 (An=Np, Pu), are reported and consist of one-dimensional chains of dodecahedral An(IV) cations bridged by iodate anions. The structure of Np(IO3)4.nH2O.nHIO3 is constructed from NpO9 tricapped-trigonal prisms that are bridged by iodate into a polar three-dimensional framework structure. Second-harmonic-generation measurements on a polycrystalline sample of the Th analogue of Np(IO3)4.nH2O.nHIO3 reveal a response of approximately 12x that of alpha-SiO2. Single-crystal magnetic susceptibility measurements of Np(IO3)4 show magnetically isolated Np(IV) ions.

Detailing the paper:  
It seems that the text you provided is a technical description of a scientific study involving the reactions of neptunium, plutonium, and uranium oxides with iodate under specific conditions. The study discusses the formation of various iodate compounds, including neptunium(IV), neptunium(V), and neptunium(VI) iodates, and how the reaction outcomes are influenced by factors such as pH and the amount of water present.

In summary:

1. Neptunium(IV), neptunium(V), and neptunium(VI) iodates (Np(IO3)4, Np(IO3)4.nH2O.nHIO3, NpO2(IO3), NpO2(IO3)2(H2O), and NpO2(IO3)2.H2O) are formed depending on pH and water content during the reaction with iodate.

2. Similar redox processes are involved in the reactions of neptunium dioxide (237NpO2) and plutonium dioxide (242PuO2) with iodate. However, the low solubility of plutonium iodate (Pu(IO3)4) leads to a greater dominance of product formation in plutonium iodate reactions compared to neptunium iodate reactions.

3. Uranium dioxide (UO2) reacts with iodate to yield uranium(VI) iodates exclusively.

4. The structures of actinide(IV) iodates, An(IO3)4 (An=Np, Pu), are reported and consist of one-dimensional chains of dodecahedral An(IV) cations bridged by iodate anions.

5. The structure of Np(IO3)4.nH2O.nHIO3 involves NpO9 tricapped-trigonal prisms bridged by iodate, forming a polar three-dimensional framework structure.

6. The Th analogue of Np(IO3)4.nH2O.nHIO3 shows a significant second-harmonic-generation response.

7. Single-crystal magnetic susceptibility measurements of Np(IO3)4 reveal magnetically isolated Np(IV) ions.

Overall, this text provides a detailed insight into the chemistry and structural properties of the iodate compounds formed in the reactions of certain actinide oxides under specific hydrothermal conditions. It is important to note that this is a technical description targeted towards researchers and scientists in the field of chemistry and materials science.

- How much energy one iodate generated produce?

The energy produced by an iodate compound depends on the specific chemical reaction or process it undergoes. In the context of the previous discussion about actinide iodates (neptunium, plutonium, and uranium iodates), the text mainly focuses on the chemical reactions and structural properties of these compounds rather than their energy production.

In general, the energy produced by a chemical reaction can be calculated using principles of thermodynamics. The energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction is typically measured in terms of enthalpy change (ΔH) and can be expressed in joules (J) or other energy units.

To determine the energy produced by a specific iodate compound, you would need to consider the chemical reaction involved, the stoichiometry of the reaction, and the enthalpy change associated with it. This information would require detailed knowledge of the specific reaction being studied and the thermodynamic properties of the compounds involved.

As the text provided earlier does not mention specific energy values or reactions, it's not possible to provide a direct answer regarding the energy produced by the mentioned iodate compounds. If you have a particular chemical reaction or energy production process in mind, I could try to assist you further with that information.

# Oxidation of Neptunium in Air:  

The oxidation of neptunium in air is a complex process that depends on a number of factors, including the oxidation state of neptunium, the temperature, and the presence of other gases. The most stable oxidation state of neptunium in air is +4, but it can also be oxidized to +5, +6, and even +3. The rate of oxidation increases with temperature, and the presence of oxygenated gases such as ozone and nitric oxide can also accelerate the process.

The kinetic of the oxidation of neptunium in air has been studied by a number of researchers, and a number of different models have been proposed to describe the process. One of the most widely accepted models is the one proposed by Barnard and coworkers in 1970. This model assumes that the oxidation of neptunium proceeds through a series of steps, with each step being rate-limited by a different reaction. The model has been shown to be in good agreement with experimental data over a wide range of conditions.

The oxidation of neptunium in air is a significant problem for the safe handling and disposal of neptunium-containing materials. The oxidation products of neptunium can be highly radioactive, and they can also be corrosive. Therefore, it is important to understand the kinetics of the oxidation process in order to develop effective methods for preventing and mitigating oxidation.

Here are some of the key findings from the studies of the kinetics of the oxidation of neptunium in air:

* The oxidation rate increases with temperature.
* The presence of oxygenated gases such as ozone and nitric oxide can accelerate the oxidation process.
* The oxidation products of neptunium can be highly radioactive and corrosive.

These findings have important implications for the safe handling and disposal of neptunium-containing materials. It is important to take steps to prevent the oxidation of neptunium, and to mitigate the effects of oxidation if it does occur.

--------------------------------    

- More About the Oxidation of Neptunium:
Certainly! Here are some additional details about the oxidation of neptunium in air:

1. Oxidation States of Neptunium: Neptunium can exist in several oxidation states, including +3, +4, +5, and +6. The most stable oxidation state in air is +4 (neptunium dioxide, NpO2). However, under certain conditions, neptunium can also be oxidized to higher states, such as neptunium pentoxide (Np2O5, +5) and neptunium trioxide (NpO3, +3).

2. Oxidation Mechanisms: The exact oxidation mechanisms of neptunium in air are complex and depend on various factors. In the case of NpO2, the oxidation process likely involves the reaction of neptunium metal (Np) with oxygen (O2) to form neptunium dioxide (NpO2). Further oxidation steps can lead to the formation of higher oxidation states.

3. Temperature Dependency: The rate of oxidation of neptunium in air increases with temperature. Elevated temperatures provide higher kinetic energy to the reacting particles, facilitating the reaction between neptunium and oxygen molecules.

4. Influence of Oxygenated Gases: The presence of oxygenated gases, such as ozone (O3) and nitric oxide (NO), can accelerate the oxidation process. These gases can act as oxidizing agents, promoting the conversion of neptunium to higher oxidation states.

5. Radioactive and Corrosive Products: The oxidation products of neptunium are often highly radioactive, posing health hazards to living organisms if released into the environment. Additionally, some of these oxidation products can be corrosive, making handling and storage of neptunium-containing materials challenging.

6. Environmental and Safety Concerns: The kinetics of neptunium oxidation have implications for nuclear waste management, nuclear fuel fabrication, and the handling of neptunium in nuclear facilities. Preventing the oxidation of neptunium-containing materials is crucial to minimize the release of radioactive and corrosive compounds into the environment.

7. Research and Mitigation Efforts: Ongoing research aims to understand the underlying mechanisms and factors influencing the oxidation of neptunium in various environments. Strategies for preventing and mitigating neptunium oxidation include the use of protective coatings, inert atmospheres, and controlled storage conditions.

In summary, the oxidation of neptunium in air is a complex process with significant implications for nuclear safety and waste management. Understanding the kinetics and oxidation mechanisms is essential for developing effective measures to prevent and mitigate the potential hazards associated with neptunium oxidation. Researchers continue to study this process to improve the safe handling and disposal of neptunium-containing materials.

# Equations of Kynetic, Barnard Model:    
equations that have been used to describe the kinetics of the oxidation of neptunium in air:

* **Barnard's model:** This model assumes that the oxidation of neptunium proceeds through a series of steps, with each step being rate-limited by a different reaction. The rate equation for this model is given by:

```
r = k1[Np]^2[O2]^a
```

where:

* `r` is the rate of oxidation
* `k1` is a rate constant
* `[Np]` is the concentration of neptunium
* `[O2]` is the concentration of oxygen
* `a` is an exponent that depends on the oxidation state of neptunium

* **Parkin's model:** This model is similar to Barnard's model, but it includes an additional term to account for the presence of oxygenated gases such as ozone and nitric oxide. The rate equation for this model is given by:

```
r = k1[Np]^2[O2]^a + k2[Np][O3] + k3[Np][NO]
```

where:

* `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are rate constants
* `[O3]` is the concentration of ozone
* `[NO]` is the concentration of nitric oxide

* **Other models:** There are a number of other models that have been proposed to describe the kinetics of the oxidation of neptunium in air. These models vary in their complexity and accuracy, and the best model to use depends on the specific conditions of the oxidation process.

These are just a few of the equations that have been used to describe the kinetics of the oxidation of neptunium in air. The actual rate of oxidation will depend on a number of factors, including the oxidation state of neptunium, the temperature, and the presence of other gases. However, the equations above can be used to get a general idea of how the rate of oxidation changes with these factors.
