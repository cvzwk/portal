# Thorium

Thorium is a chemical element with the symbol **Th** and atomic number 90. It is a silvery-white, dense, ductile, and strongly radioactive metal. Thorium is the heaviest naturally occurring element and is found in very small quantities in the Earth's crust. It is mined for its use as a fuel in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons.

Thorium is a very reactive element and can react with a variety of other elements. It is also a strong emitter of radiation, which can be harmful to human health. Thorium has a long half-life, meaning that it takes a very long time for it to decay. This makes it a suitable fuel for nuclear power plants, as the radioactivity will last for many years.

Thorium is also a potential source of nuclear weapons. When thorium is enriched to a high enough level of radioactivity, it can be used to create a nuclear bomb.

The use of thorium has been controversial, due to the potential for nuclear weapons proliferation and the environmental hazards associated with thorium mining and processing.

Here are some of the properties of thorium:

* Atomic number: 90
* Atomic mass: 232.03806 u
* Melting point: 1,750 °C (3,180 °F)
* Boiling point: 4,788 °C (8,648 °F)
* Density: 11.72 g/cm3
* Electronegativity: 1.36
* Valence: 3, 4

Thorium is a very important element with a wide range of applications. It is used in nuclear power plants, nuclear weapons, and a variety of other applications. However, it is also a very dangerous element and should be handled with care.
