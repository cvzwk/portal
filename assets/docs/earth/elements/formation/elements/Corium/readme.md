# Corium  

Corium is a mixture of molten nuclear reactor fuel and structural materials that can form during a severe nuclear accident. The composition of corium varies depending on the specific reactor design and fuel used, but it typically consists of uranium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, and/or stainless steel.

The formation of corium occurs when the fuel rods in nuclear reactors overheat and melt due to a loss of cooling, resulting in the release of radioactive material into the environment. The chemical equations involved in the formation of corium can be complex and depend on the reactor design and the specific materials involved.

However, here is an example of the main reactions involved in the formation of corium for a typical pressurized water reactor (PWR) design:

1. Loss of coolant and control rod insertion:

In a PWR design, the core is cooled by pressurized water, which is circulated through the reactor core and then through a steam generator to produce steam for electricity generation.

If the coolant flow is interrupted due to a loss of coolant accident (LOCA), the fuel rods will start to heat up and may eventually melt.

At the same time, control rods made of neutron-absorbing materials such as boron are inserted into the reactor core to prevent a runaway chain reaction.

2. Fuel rod melting and clad degradation:

As the fuel rods heat up, the uranium dioxide (UO2) fuel pellets inside them will start to melt, releasing fission products such as iodine and cesium.

The zirconium cladding surrounding the fuel pellets will also start to oxidize and degrade, releasing hydrogen gas and more fission products.

3. Melt pool formation and corium formation:

As the fuel rods continue to heat up, the molten fuel and cladding materials will collect at the bottom of the reactor vessel, where they will mix with other structural materials such as stainless steel.

The resulting mixture, known as corium, will have a variety of chemical species and phases, depending on the specific materials involved and their relative concentrations.

The exact chemical reactions involved in corium formation are highly complex and depend on a variety of factors, including temperature, pressure, and chemical composition.

Overall, the formation of corium in a severe nuclear accident is a complex and highly unfavorable scenario that can have significant environmental and health impacts.
