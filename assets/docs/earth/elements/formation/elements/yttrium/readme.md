# Yttrium   

is a chemical element with the symbol Y and atomic number 39. It is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and has often been classified as a "rare-earth element".     
Yttrium is almost always found in combination with lanthanide elements in rare-earth minerals, and is never found in nature as a free element.

Yttrium has a number of important properties, including:

* It is a good conductor of heat and electricity.
* It is resistant to corrosion.
* It has a high melting point and boiling point.
* It is a strong reducing agent.

Yttrium is used in a variety of applications, including:

* **Glass and ceramics:** Yttrium is added to glass and ceramics to improve their properties, such as their strength, toughness, and resistance to heat and chemicals.
* **Magnetic materials:** Yttrium is used to make permanent magnets and to control the magnetic properties of other materials.
* **High-temperature superconductors:** Yttrium is a component of some high-temperature superconductors. These materials have the ability to conduct electricity with no resistance at very high temperatures.
* **Nuclear fuel:** Yttrium is a potential fuel for nuclear reactors. It has a high melting point and boiling point, which makes it well-suited for use in high-temperature environments. Yttrium is also a good neutron absorber, which makes it useful for controlling the reaction in a nuclear reactor.
* **Medical applications:** Yttrium-90 is a radioactive isotope of yttrium that is used in medical applications. It is used to treat cancer and to destroy tumors.

Yttrium is a relatively rare element, but it is becoming more important due to its unique properties. It is a valuable resource that has a wide range of potential applications.

Here are some additional information about yttrium:

* The name yttrium comes from the Swedish town of Ytterby, where it was first discovered in 1794.
* The most abundant source of yttrium is the mineral xenotime.
* Yttrium is a relatively soft metal, with a Mohs hardness of 2.5.
* Yttrium has a density of 4.47 g/cm3.
* The melting point of yttrium is 1,522°C and the boiling point is 3,338°C.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. 

Yttrium hydride (YH5) is a binary compound of yttrium and hydrogen. It is a dark gray, hygroscopic solid with a melting point of 1,165°C and a boiling point of 1,770°C. YH5 is a strong reducing agent and is used in a variety of applications, including:

* **Nuclear fuel:** YH5 is a potential fuel for nuclear reactors. It has a high melting point and boiling point, which makes it well-suited for use in high-temperature environments. YH5 is also a good neutron absorber, which makes it useful for controlling the reaction in a nuclear reactor.
* **High-temperature superconductors:** YH5 is a component of some high-temperature superconductors. These materials have the ability to conduct electricity with no resistance at very high temperatures. YH5 helps to improve the superconducting properties of these materials.
* **Magnetic materials:** YH5 is a magnetic material. It can be used to make permanent magnets and to control the magnetic properties of other materials.
* **Gas sensors:** YH5 can be used to make gas sensors. These sensors can be used to detect the presence of certain gases, such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane.

YH5 is a relatively safe compound, but it can be harmful if inhaled or ingested. It is also a fire hazard and should be handled with care.

Here are some additional information about yttrium hydride:

* The chemical formula for yttrium hydride is YH5.
* The molar mass of yttrium hydride is 177.72 g/mol.
* The density of yttrium hydride is 5.5 g/cm3.
* The solubility of yttrium hydride in water is 0.01 g/L
