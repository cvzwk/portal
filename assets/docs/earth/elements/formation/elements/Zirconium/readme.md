# Zirconium (Zr)   

is a chemical element with the atomic number 40. It is a lustrous, grey-white, strong transition metal that resembles hafnium and has the highest atomic number of the stable lanthanide and actinide series. Zirconium is not found as a free element in nature, but is found in many minerals, including zircon, baddeleyite, and mosandrite.

Zirconium is a very versatile metal with a wide range of applications. It is used in a variety of industries, including:

* **Nuclear power:** Zirconium is used in nuclear reactors because it is a good neutron moderator and has a high melting point.
* **Aerospace:** Zirconium is used in aircraft and spacecraft because it is strong and lightweight.
* **Chemical processing:** Zirconium is used in chemical processing because it is resistant to corrosion.
* **Medical implants:** Zirconium is used in medical implants because it is biocompatible.

Zirconium is a relatively safe metal, but it can be toxic if it is inhaled or ingested. It is also a fire hazard, so it should be handled with care.

Here are some of the properties of zirconium:

* Atomic number: 40
* Atomic mass: 91.224
* Melting point: 1,852 °C (3,366 °F)
* Boiling point: 4,310 °C (7,870 °F)
* Density: 6.51 g/cm3
* Electronegativity: 1.33
* Valence: 4

Zirconium is a very important metal with a wide range of applications. It is a strong, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant metal that is also biocompatible. Zirconium is used in a variety of industries, including nuclear power, aerospace, chemical processing, and medical implants.

# Zirconium Hydride (ZrH4)   

Zirconium hydride (ZrH4) is a white solid that is highly flammable. It is a metal hydride, which means that it is a compound of hydrogen and a metal. Zirconium hydride is used in a variety of applications, including:

* **Hydrogen storage:** Zirconium hydride can be used to store hydrogen gas. It is a good candidate for hydrogen storage because it has a high gravimetric density (the amount of hydrogen that can be stored per unit mass of the material) and a high volumetric density (the amount of hydrogen that can be stored per unit volume of the material).
* **Fuel cells:** Zirconium hydride can be used in fuel cells. Fuel cells are devices that convert the chemical energy of a fuel into electrical energy. Zirconium hydride is a good candidate for fuel cells because it is a source of hydrogen gas, which is one of the reactants in a fuel cell.
* **Catalysts:** Zirconium hydride can be used as a catalyst. Catalysts are substances that can speed up chemical reactions without being consumed in the reaction. Zirconium hydride is a good candidate for catalysts because it is a strong reducing agent.

Zirconium hydride is a relatively safe material, but it can be toxic if it is inhaled or ingested. It is also a fire hazard, so it should be handled with care.

Here are some of the properties of zirconium hydride:

* Formula: ZrH4
* Molar mass: 132.22 g/mol
* Melting point: 1,833 °C (3,331 °F)
* Boiling point: 3,400 °C (6,140 °F)
* Density: 6.54 g/cm3
* Electronegativity: 1.4
* Valence: 4

Zirconium hydride is a versatile material with a wide range of applications. It is a good candidate for hydrogen storage, fuel cells, and catalysts. It is a relatively safe material, but it should be handled with care because it is flammable and toxic.
