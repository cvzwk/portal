# Germanium-71  

is an isotope of the element germanium. An isotope is a variant of an element that has the same number of protons (and hence the same chemical properties) but a different number of neutrons in the nucleus. In the case of germanium-71:

- Protons: 32 (Since germanium has 32 protons in all its isotopes)
- Neutrons: 39
- Atomic Mass: Approximately 70.924 g/mol (since protons + neutrons = atomic mass)

Germanium-71 is a stable isotope of germanium, meaning it does not undergo radioactive decay. The element germanium itself is a metalloid and has various applications in electronics, fiber optics, and infrared optics due to its semiconductor properties. The different isotopes of germanium, including germanium-71, are studied for scientific research and various industrial applications.
