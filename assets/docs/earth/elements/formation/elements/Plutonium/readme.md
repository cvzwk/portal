# Plutonium:

Plutonium is a chemical element with the symbol **Pu** and atomic number 94. It is a silvery-gray metal that is highly radioactive. Plutonium is a synthetic element, meaning that it does not occur naturally. It was first created in 1940 by Glenn Seaborg and his team at the University of California, Berkeley.

Plutonium is a very reactive element and can react with a variety of other elements. It is also a strong emitter of radiation, which can be harmful to human health. Plutonium has a long half-life, meaning that it takes a very long time for it to decay. This makes it a suitable fuel for nuclear power plants, as the radioactivity will last for many years.

Plutonium is also a potential source of nuclear weapons. When plutonium is enriched to a high enough level of radioactivity, it can be used to create a nuclear bomb.

The use of plutonium has been controversial, due to the potential for nuclear weapons proliferation and the environmental hazards associated with plutonium mining and processing.

Here are some of the properties of plutonium:

* Atomic number: 94
* Atomic mass: 244.0642 u
* Melting point: 640 °C (1,184 °F)
* Boiling point: 3,232 °C (5,840 °F)
* Density: 19.84 g/cm3
* Electronegativity: 1.28
* Valence: 3, 4

Plutonium is a very important element with a wide range of applications. It is used in nuclear power plants, nuclear weapons, and a variety of other applications. However, it is also a very dangerous element and should be handled with care.

Here are some of the potential applications of plutonium:

* **Nuclear power:** Plutonium can be used as a fuel in nuclear power plants. It is a very efficient way to produce energy, and it does not produce any greenhouse gases.
* **Nuclear weapons:** Plutonium can be used to create nuclear weapons. However, this is a controversial application, and there are concerns about the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
* **Medical applications:** Plutonium has a number of potential medical applications. It can be used to treat cancer and other diseases.
* **Industrial applications:** Plutonium has a number of potential industrial applications. It can be used to make a variety of materials, including alloys, ceramics, and glasses.

Plutonium is a promising element with a variety of potential applications. However, it is also a very dangerous element and should only be handled by trained professionals.

7 kg of plutonium-239 have **1.25 x 10^24** atoms.

The mass of a single plutonium-239 atom is 239.05215 u, and 7 kg is equal to 7000 g. Therefore, the number of atoms in 7 kg of plutonium-239 is 7000 g / 239.05215 u * 6.02214076 x 10^23 atoms/u = 1.25 x 10^24 atoms.

Here is the calculation:

```
mass of plutonium-239 * Avogadro's number = number of atoms
7000 g * 6.02214076 x 10^23 atoms/u = 1.25 x 10^24 atoms
```

Plutonium-239 is a radioactive element with a half-life of 24,100 years. This means that half of the atoms in a sample of plutonium-239 will decay into other elements after 24,100 years. After 48,200 years, only a quarter of the atoms will remain, and so on.

The number of atoms in 7 kg of plutonium-239 will decrease over time as the atoms decay. However, the number will still be significant for many years to come.
