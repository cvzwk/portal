# Uranium:

* Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol **U** and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-white, dense, ductile, and strongly radioactive metal.

* Uranium is the heaviest naturally occurring element and is found in very small quantities in the Earth's crust. It is mined for its use as a fuel in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons.
* Uranium is a very reactive element and can react with a variety of other elements. It is also a strong emitter of radiation, which can be harmful to human health.
* Uranium has a long half-life, meaning that it takes a very long time for it to decay. This makes it a suitable fuel for nuclear power plants, as the radioactivity will last for many years.
* Uranium is also a potential source of nuclear weapons. When uranium is enriched to a high enough level of radioactivity, it can be used to create a nuclear bomb.
* The use of uranium has been controversial, due to the potential for nuclear weapons proliferation and the environmental hazards associated with uranium mining and processing.

Here are some of the properties of uranium:

* Atomic number: 92
* Atomic mass: 238.0289 u
* Melting point: 1,132 °C (2,070 °F)
* Boiling point: 3,818 °C (7,004 °F)
* Density: 19.1 g/cm3
* Electronegativity: 1.38
* Valence: 3, 4, 5, 6

Uranium is a very important element with a wide range of applications. It is used in nuclear power plants, nuclear weapons, and a variety of other applications. However, it is also a very dangerous element and should be handled with care.
