# Uranium-238 (U-238) → Thorium-234 (Th-234) + Alpha Particle

In this reaction, Uranium-238 undergoes alpha decay to produce Thorium-234 and an alpha particle. Uranium-238 has a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, which is much greater than 15 minutes. The molar mass of Thorium-234 is approximately 234 g/mol, and the molar mass of an alpha particle (helium-4 nucleus) is approximately 4 g/mol. When you sum the molar masses of Thorium-234 and the alpha particle, it is greater than 1000 g/mol.
