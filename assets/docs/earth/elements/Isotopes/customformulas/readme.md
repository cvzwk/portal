Uranium-238 (U-238) â†’ Thorium-234 (Th-234) + Alpha Particle

In this reaction, Uranium-238 undergoes alpha decay to produce Thorium-234 and an alpha particle. Uranium-238 has a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, which is much greater than 15 minutes. The molar mass of Thorium-234 is approximately 234 g/mol, and the molar mass of an alpha particle (helium-4 nucleus) is approximately 4 g/mol. When you sum the molar masses of Thorium-234 and the alpha particle, it is greater than 1000 g/mol.

- Properties:
Sure, here are the properties of Uranium-238 (U-238), Thorium-234 (Th-234), and the Alpha Particle:

1. Uranium-238 (U-238):
   - Molar Mass: Approximately 238 g/mol
   - Half-life: About 4.5 billion years
   - Decay Mode: Uranium-238 undergoes alpha decay, transforming into Thorium-234 and emitting an alpha particle.

2. Thorium-234 (Th-234):
   - Molar Mass: Approximately 234 g/mol
   - Half-life: About 24.1 days
   - Decay Mode: Thorium-234 is formed through alpha decay of Uranium-238. It eventually undergoes beta decay to Protactinium-234.

3. Alpha Particle (Helium-4 nucleus):
   - Molar Mass: Approximately 4 g/mol
   - Charge: Positive (+2)
   - Half-life: Alpha particles have a very short lifetime and typically travel only a few centimeters in air before losing their energy.

The alpha decay of Uranium-238 into Thorium-234 and an alpha particle is a natural radioactive process that occurs in the Earth's crust. It is part of the decay chain of uranium and plays a significant role in the Earth's geology and radioactivity. The release of alpha particles during this decay process contributes to the overall radiation levels in the environment.
