# Isotopes    
are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. The number of protons in an atom determines its atomic number, which is the same for all isotopes of an element. The number of neutrons determines the isotope's mass number.

For example, carbon has an atomic number of 6, which means that all carbon atoms have 6 protons. However, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14. Carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, carbon-13 has 7 neutrons, and carbon-14 has 8 neutrons.

Isotopes can be stable or radioactive. Stable isotopes do not decay over time, while radioactive isotopes do. Radioactive isotopes emit radiation, which can be harmful to living things. However, radioactive isotopes can also be used for medical and industrial purposes.

Here are some of the uses of isotopes:

* **Medical:** Isotopes are used in medical imaging, such as PET scans and CT scans. They can also be used to treat cancer.
* **Industrial:** Isotopes are used in a variety of industrial applications, such as food irradiation and leak detection.
* **Scientific research:** Isotopes are used in scientific research to study the structure of atoms and molecules, the behavior of matter, and the origins of the universe.

Isotopes are a fascinating and important part of the natural world. They have a wide range of uses, and they continue to be studied by scientists around the world.

* The term "isotope" comes from the Greek words "isos" (same) and "topos" (place).
* The first isotopes were discovered in the late 19th century.
* There are over 3,000 known isotopes, but only about 300 of them are stable.
* The most common isotope of hydrogen is protium, which has no neutrons.
* The most abundant isotope of carbon is carbon-12, which has 6 neutrons.
* The most radioactive isotope of uranium is uranium-235, which has 92 protons and 143 neutrons.
