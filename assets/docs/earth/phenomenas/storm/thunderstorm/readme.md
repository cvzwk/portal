# ThunderStorm's

Thunderstorms are natural weather phenomena that involve the buildup and discharge of electrical energy in the atmosphere. During a thunderstorm, lightning is produced as a result of the movement of charges between different parts of the atmosphere, such as between clouds or between clouds and the ground.

The electromagnetic interactions within a thunderstorm are complex and involve the movement of charged particles, primarily electrons and ions. These interactions create electric and magnetic fields that can be observed and measured using scientific instruments. The direction of the charge movement within a thunderstorm is influenced by factors such as the distribution of charges within clouds and the surrounding environment.

If you are interested in the specific electromagnetic interactions and phenomena within a thunderstorm, topics like atmospheric physics, lightning formation, and electromagnetic field measurements would be relevant areas to explore.

- Eletromagnetic Camp between Metallic Object and Thunderstorm

Observing the electromagnetic field between the object and the thunderstorm involves using various scientific instruments, such as electromagnetic field sensors and detectors. These tools can measure changes in electric and magnetic fields caused by the interaction between the object and the thunderstorm.

By placing sensors near the object and in the vicinity of the thunderstorm, researchers can record fluctuations in the electromagnetic field strength and direction. This data can help in understanding the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between the two entities.

Keep in mind that directly observing these interactions might require specialized equipment and controlled conditions due to the potentially hazardous nature of thunderstorms.

- Manipulating the Nature Force, Directionating the thunderstorm after attracted

Theoretically and technically directing the discharge from a thunderstorm to a specific direction after it has hit an object involves advanced techniques that are still under research and development. Here's a basic overview:

**Theoretical Approach:**
1. **Lightning Rods:** One theoretical method involves using lightning rods or conductive materials strategically placed on the object. These materials are designed to attract and capture the lightning discharge, providing a controlled path for the electrical energy to follow.

2. **Electric Fields:** Creating a localized electric field around the object could potentially influence the direction of the discharge. However, this method would require a deep understanding of the atmospheric conditions, electric field manipulation, and the properties of the thunderstorm.

**Technical Approach:**
1. **Lightning Diverters:** Advanced lightning protection systems might utilize a combination of lightning rods, grounding systems, and conductive pathways to guide the discharge away from critical areas. These systems aim to provide a low-resistance path for the lightning to follow, reducing the risk of damage.

2. **Electrical Engineering:** Implementing complex electrical systems that can sense the buildup of charge and discharge it in a controlled manner could help direct the lightning discharge. However, this is an intricate and challenging task due to the immense energy involved in lightning.

It's important to note that manipulating lightning is highly challenging due to its unpredictable and powerful nature. Attempting to redirect or control lightning can have serious safety risks and should only be done by professionals with extensive knowledge in lightning protection and electrical engineering.
