# ThunderStorm's

Thunderstorms are natural weather phenomena that involve the buildup and discharge of electrical energy in the atmosphere. During a thunderstorm, lightning is produced as a result of the movement of charges between different parts of the atmosphere, such as between clouds or between clouds and the ground.

The electromagnetic interactions within a thunderstorm are complex and involve the movement of charged particles, primarily electrons and ions. These interactions create electric and magnetic fields that can be observed and measured using scientific instruments. The direction of the charge movement within a thunderstorm is influenced by factors such as the distribution of charges within clouds and the surrounding environment.

If you are interested in the specific electromagnetic interactions and phenomena within a thunderstorm, topics like atmospheric physics, lightning formation, and electromagnetic field measurements would be relevant areas to explore.
