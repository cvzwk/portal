The phenomenon you're referring to is known as "tidal locking." Tidal locking occurs when the rotation period of a celestial body matches its orbital period, causing one side of the object to always face the body it orbits. The most famous example of tidal locking is the Moon's relationship with Earth.

The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that one side of the Moon (the near side) is always facing us, while the other side (the far side) remains hidden from view. This locking was caused by gravitational interactions between the Earth and the Moon over billions of years.

Tidal locking happens due to the gravitational forces exerted by both bodies on each other. Over time, these forces slow down the rotation of the smaller body (in this case, the Moon) until it matches its orbital period. This phenomenon isn't unique to the Earth-Moon system; it can occur between any two celestial bodies with strong gravitational interactions.

Tidal locking is a fascinating outcome of gravitational dynamics in space and has important effects on the way celestial bodies interact and evolve over time.
