# proto-Earth
   typically refers to the early stage of Earth's formation before it reached its current size and structure.    
    During this phase, the proto-Earth was still in the process of accretion and differentiation.       
     Here's a more detailed explanation:   

   1. Accretion:    
       As mentioned earlier,   
        the proto-Earth formed through the accumulation of planetesimals and other smaller bodies in the protoplanetary disk.   
         These collisions and mergers gradually built up the proto-Earth's mass over millions of years.    

   2. Differentiation:   
       As the proto-Earth grew larger, it started to undergo differentiation.   
        This process involved the separation of materials based on their density.    
         The denser materials, such as iron and nickel, sank towards the center, forming the Earth's core.    
          The lighter materials formed the mantle and crust.   

   3. Late Heavy Bombardment:   
       During the period known as the Late Heavy Bombardment,   
        which occurred around 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago,   
         the proto-Earth experienced a significant influx of asteroids and comets.   
          This intense period of impacts reshaped the surface of the proto-Earth and contributed   
           to the formation of the Moon through the collision with Theia.    

   4. Atmosphere and Oceans:    
       As the proto-Earth accumulated more material, it also attracted gases from the protoplanetary disk.        
        These gases, including water vapor, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and others,     
         eventually formed the Earth's early atmosphere.   
          Over time, the atmosphere cooled, and the water vapor condensed to form the Earth's oceans.     
   
   The term "proto-Earth" is often used to refer to the stage before the Moon-forming impact,   
    as that event had a significant influence on the subsequent evolution of Earth.     
     By studying ancient rocks, isotopic dating, and computer simulations,     
      scientists have been able to infer and piece together    
       the likely processes and events that led to the formation of our planet.

# Formation - Proto Earth  
 The formation of the proto-Earth, or the early Earth,  
  is a topic of scientific study and speculation based on geological evidence, astronomical observations, and theoretical models.    
   While we don't have direct observations of the formation process,   
    scientists have developed theories to understand how our planet might have come into existence.     
     Here's a general overview of the formation of the proto-Earth:   

   1. Solar Nebula:  
       Approximately 4.6 billion years ago, a vast cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula existed in space.   
        This nebula was a remnant of a previous supernova explosion and contained various elements and compounds.    

   2. Collapse and Accretion:    
       Gravity caused the solar nebula to collapse inward,    
        leading to the formation of a spinning disk known as the protoplanetary disk.     
         Within this disk, particles of dust and ice started to collide and stick together,       
          gradually growing into larger objects called planetesimals.    

   3. Proto-Earth Formation:    
       Over millions of years, planetesimals continued to collide and merge, forming a growing body known as the proto-Earth.    
        This process is called accretion.    
         The proto-Earth's gravity further attracted other objects in its vicinity,     
          including other planetesimals and smaller bodies, contributing to its growth.    

   4. Differentiation:    
       As the proto-Earth grew larger,   
        it generated enough heat due to the energy of collisions and radioactive decay within its interior.    
         This heat led to the process of differentiation, where denser materials, such as iron and nickel,      
          sank towards the center, forming the Earth's core, while lighter materials formed the mantle and crust.    

   5. [Moon Formation:](/assets/docs/moon/readme.md)   
       Around 4.5 billion years ago, a Mars-sized object called Theia collided with the proto-Earth in a giant impact event.   
        This collision caused a significant portion of the proto-Earth's mantle and material from Theia to be ejected into space.     
         Over time, this debris coalesced to form the Moon.   

   6. Final Stages:    
       As the proto-Earth continued to accumulate material, its gravity became stronger,    
        attracting more gas and dust from the protoplanetary disk.    
         Eventually,    
          the remaining gas and dust were either swept away by solar winds or incorporated into the Earth's atmosphere.     

   It's important to note that the formation of the proto-Earth is a complex process,    
    and there are ongoing studies and debates among scientists to refine our understanding of the details.    
     However,    
      the general framework described above provides a basis for our current understanding of how our planet came to be.
