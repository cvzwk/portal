# proto-Earth
   typically refers to the early stage of Earth's formation before it reached its current size and structure.    
    During this phase, the proto-Earth was still in the process of accretion and differentiation.       
     Here's a more detailed explanation:   

   1. Accretion:    
       As mentioned earlier,   
        the proto-Earth formed through the accumulation of planetesimals and other smaller bodies in the protoplanetary disk.   
         These collisions and mergers gradually built up the proto-Earth's mass over millions of years.    

   2. Differentiation:   
       As the proto-Earth grew larger, it started to undergo differentiation.   
        This process involved the separation of materials based on their density.    
         The denser materials, such as iron and nickel, sank towards the center, forming the Earth's core.    
          The lighter materials formed the mantle and crust.   

   3. Late Heavy Bombardment:   
       During the period known as the Late Heavy Bombardment,   
        which occurred around 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago,   
         the proto-Earth experienced a significant influx of asteroids and comets.   
          This intense period of impacts reshaped the surface of the proto-Earth and contributed   
           to the formation of the Moon through the collision with Theia.    

   4. Atmosphere and Oceans:    
       As the proto-Earth accumulated more material, it also attracted gases from the protoplanetary disk.        
        These gases, including water vapor, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and others,     
         eventually formed the Earth's early atmosphere.   
          Over time, the atmosphere cooled, and the water vapor condensed to form the Earth's oceans.     
   
   The term "proto-Earth" is often used to refer to the stage before the Moon-forming impact,   
    as that event had a significant influence on the subsequent evolution of Earth.     
     By studying ancient rocks, isotopic dating, and computer simulations,     
      scientists have been able to infer and piece together    
       the likely processes and events that led to the formation of our planet.
