# Primordial Nucleosynthesis:    
  This refers to the formation of light elements in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang.    
   During this period, the universe was extremely hot and dense.    
    Protons and neutrons combined to form atomic nuclei, primarily of hydrogen (H), helium (He), and traces of lithium (Li).    
     Primordial nucleosynthesis is responsible for the initial abundance of these light elements in the universe.
