# One sequencer to generate custom chains of aminoacids per categorie

The categories of amino acids that were mentioned earlier have specific meanings in relation to their chemical properties and biological functions.   
 Here is the general meaning of each amino acid category:  

1. Polar: Polar amino acids are hydrophilic, that is, they have an affinity for water. They have polar functional groups in their side chains that can form hydrogen bonds with water. These amino acids play important roles in interactions with aqueous solvents and protein structures.

2. Non-polar: Non-polar amino acids are hydrophobic, which means they have a low affinity for water. Their side chains are predominantly composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, which makes them insoluble in water. These amino acids are often found inside proteins and play a key role in structural stability.

3. Charged: Charged amino acids, also known as polar charged amino acids, have an electrical charge in their side chains. They can be positively charged (basic) or negatively charged (acidic). These amino acids play a crucial role in electrostatic interactions within proteins and are often found on protein surfaces.

4. Aromatic: Aromatic amino acids have aromatic rings in their structures. These amino acids, such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan and histidine, have special light absorption characteristics and can participate in hydrophobic interactions and stabilization of protein structures.

These categories are useful for classifying amino acids based on their physicochemical properties and help in understanding their biological functions in proteins. It is noteworthy that some amino acids may have characteristics of more than one category, depending on their structure.
